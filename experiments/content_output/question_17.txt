Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it contains a certain concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

Wait, the problem says the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, because stoichiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So the complex is CaY²− if EDTA is the fourth ion. Oh no, wait, EDTA⁴−, so calcium is Ca²+, so yes, the formula is CaY²−?

And the KCa-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. That's the formation constant, right. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is really large, which means the complex is very stable. But I'm trying to find the concentration of free calcium ions, not the complex.

Oh, right! The formation of the complex can be described by the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ↔ CaEDTA²−. And the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]) = 5e10.

But wait, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex in 0.02 M. So that means the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²−], is 0.02 M. Then, what's the [Ca²+]?

And because Kf is very large, that should mean that almost all the calcium is in the complex form, so free calcium concentration should be very low. So I need to calculate [Ca²+].

Wait, but how? The solution must assume that EDTA is present in excess, because otherwise, knowing the concentration of the complex doesn't directly give the free ions. But the problem states that the solution is containing 0.02 M of the complex, which is stoichiometric. Wait, so for every mole of Ca²+ used, that's the same as the EDTA. But am I considering the total EDTA or the free EDTA?

No wait, in a stoichiometric scenario, perhaps I can model the system as follows: Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So that's the only form of EDTA? Or not. Maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, suppose the solution contains only the Ca-EDTA complex, or is the EDTA in excess?

The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but since it's called "stoichiometric", which usually implies that the mole ratio is 1:1. So because how the answer is designed, perhaps it's a 1:1 complex. But when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− ions.

Wait, perhaps maybe the setup is that we have the complex CaY²− at 0.02 M. Then, Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y⁴−] ) =5e10. But what's [Y⁴−] ?

Assuming that the initial EDTA is in excess, but in this case, if the complex is 0.02 M and we start from that, perhaps I can assume that [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are equal because of the stoichiometry. Because for every mole of complex, you get one mole of Ca2+ and one mole of Y^4− upon dissociation (the reverse reaction).

Wait, let me think. If dissociation leads to each complex giving one Ca²+ and one Y⁴− , then the dissociation reaction is:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴−.

So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = [Y⁴−] = x.

So given that Kf for the formation is given, and Kf is the formation constant, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant for the reverse reaction. Let me clarify.

Wait, Kf is the formation constant: Kf = [CaY^2−]/([Ca^2+][Y^4−]) ). So if at equilibrium, [CaY] is 0.02 M because that's the given concentration. Wait, no, that's not correct. No: wait, the total concentration is the sum of all species. So, if the concentration of Ca-Y complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the other species are negligible except for the dissociated ones, then [CaY²−] + [free Ca²+] and [free Y⁴−] would be what?

Wait, perhaps let's model it.

Let me consider [CaY] as 0.02 M. Let the amount of dissociation be 'y'. Then the changes in concentration would be as follows: upon dissociation, each mole of CaY produces a mole of Ca²+ and a mole of Y⁴−. So at equilibrium:

[CaY] = 0.02 - y. 

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps we need to model it a bit differently.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that the solution only consists of the complex (so all EDTA is in the complex; but that's probably not true because Kf is so large). But with Kf being large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] must be very small.

Wait, maybe we should consider that the 0.02 M solution is the solution chemistry, where the only other component is the complex. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the total EDTA and calcium are in solution as the complex. Like, [CaY] =0.02 M, no other form of EDTA or Ca is present except what comes from this dissociation.

Wait, but that's probably not possible because of the dissociation equilibrium. So the exact [Ca²+] and [Y^4−} would be related through the Kf expression.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Since Kf is very large, the majority of Ca²+ exists in the complexed form. But let's proceed step by step.

The complex's concentration is 0.02 M, so that's [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 M.

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²−}/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) )= Kf =5e10. So 0.02/( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−} )=5e10.

But since the reaction is 1:1, on dissociation of one complex, you get one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴−. So for each molecule of complex that dissociates, [Ca²+] increases by 1x that amount, and [EDTA] increases by that same amount, correct?

Wait, but what is [EDTA⁴−] in solution if all EDTA comes from the complex? Or is some EDTA present? The problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M of the complex; I'm assuming that the other species (Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−) come from this dissociation.

Wait, then perhaps the moles of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− are equal because each complex breakage releases one of each.

Wait, but then [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−} ] = x.

So substituting into the Kf equation:

0.02 / (x^2) )=5e10.

Wait, so:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10 )

x² = 0.02/(5e10 ) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) *1e-13 = 0.4e-13.

So x²=4e-14.

Wait, no, wait: Let me properly compute 0.02 is 2e-2.

So (2e-2)/(5e10) ) is (2/(5e12)) ) → 2e-13 /5 → 4e-14.

Wait, (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5e12)) )= (0.4e-12 )= 4e-13 / 1e1 = no, wait: 2/(5e12) = approx 4e-13?

Let me calculate: 2e-2 divided by5e10 is (2/5)*(1e-2/1e10) )=0.4 *1e-12= 4e-13.

So x^2=4e-13 ⇒ x ≈ sqrt(4e-13 ) = 2e-6.5 ≈ about 2e-6.5 is 3.16e-7? Wait, because sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. 10^-6.5 is app 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 M.

Hmm, 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13 )= 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7, which is roughly 6.3 x10^-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. But let me recheck because sometimes I make mistakes in simplifications.

Alternatively, writing Kf as [CaEDTA]/([Ca][Y])=Kf.

Assuming [Ca] = [Y] = x, from the dissociation.

Then, 0.02/( x² ) =5e10 → x²=0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10= (2/5) e-12= 4e-13.

Wait, wait a second: 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) e-12= 0.4e-12= 4e-13. So x squared equals 4e-13, so x=2e-6.5 is same as√0.4e-12 = roughly 6.3e-7. So that matches option C.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f \), which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{Y}^{4-}]\), denoted as \( x \). Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**
