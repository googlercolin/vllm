Question: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.
A) 2.0x10^-2 M 
B) 5.0x10^-3 M
C) 6.3x10^-7 M
D) 1.0x10^-2 M 

Assistant Response:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formation constant \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) of the calcium-EDTA complex, which is given as \(5 \times 10^{10}\).

The dissociation of the complex in solution can be represented as:
\[ \text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{-} \]

The formation constant expression is:
\[ K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]} \]

Assuming the solution is that of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and all the calcium is initially in the form of the complex, the concentration of the complex is initially 0.02 M. As the complex dissociates, let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Therefore, the concentration of \(\text{EDTA}^{-}\) will also be \(x\), and the concentration of the complex will be \(0.02 - x\).

For simplicity, if \(x\) is very small compared to 0.02 (which it typically will be given the large formation constant), we can approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \approx \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02} = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \]

Given \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\):
\[ 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \]
\[ x^2 = 5 \times 10^{10} \times 0.02 \]
\[ x^2 = 1 \times 10^9 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{1 \times 10^9} \]
\[ x = 1 \times 10^{4.5} = 1 \times 10^4 / 3.16 = 3.16 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ x \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\).
