Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see, a spin-half particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Hmm, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator.

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. So I need to calculate <ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ>.

Wait, expectation values usually involve measuring the average value. Right, for any operator O, the expectation is ⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

I remember that for expectation values of σz and σx, since they're Pauli matrices, their expectation values can be found using the coefficients of the state.

The σz operator's eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So, each term in the expectation value can be calculated separately.

Also, because the expectation value is linear, I can split this into 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Right, so first I'll calculate ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a combination of σz eigenstates, the expectation of σz is given by the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so its probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, for |↓⟩ the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. Its square is (3/4)= 0.75.

So, σz expectation is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) because the eigenvalue for |↑⟩ is +1 and |↓⟩ is -1. Let's compute that: (0.25)(1) = 0.25, (0.75)(-1) )= -0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 - 0.75 gives -0.5.

Okay, so ⊐σz⟩ = -0.5.

Now for σx. The expectation of σx in a spin state is a bit trickier. I think it's equal to the probability of the state being in the |→⟩ state, which is eigenstate of σx, but wait, maybe I should compute it using the coefficients.

Alternatively, I recall that σx is the Pauli X matrix. In terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

Hmm, yes. So the expectation value for σx is computed as:
⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩.

Expanding this, |ψ⟩ is a*(|↑⟩) + b*(|↓⟩), where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

So σx applies as following: σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So applying σx to |ψ⟩, you get a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩.

Then, the inner product with ψ would be (a') (a^* ) + (b') (b^*) ?

Wait, let me do it step by step.

⟨ψ|σx = a^* ⟨↑| + b^* ⟨↓| multiplied by σx which, when applied to |ψ⟩, gives a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

So inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ would be a* b + b* a.

Wait, let me see more carefully.

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a)^* times ⟨↑| σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ ) + (b)^* times ⟨↓| σx (a |↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ )

Wait, upon σx applied to the composite state, that's a |↑⟩ → a |↓⟩ and b |↓⟩ → b |↑⟩, so:

σx|ψ⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

Then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = ⟨ a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| | a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩ ⟩.

So that's a* times a 〈↑ | ↓〉 + a* times a b 〈↑ | ↑〉 ... no, wait, I think this is better approached as:

⟨ψ |σx |ψ⟩ = (a)*(0) * a ) + (a) * (b) (some inner products) ... Wait no, matrix representation is probably better here.

Alternatively, considering Pauli matrices in matrix form. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state vector |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let me see:

The state |ψ⟩ can be written as:

[ a ]

[ b ]

where a = 0.5, and b = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Hmm, but earlier the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, which becomes (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in a column vector.

Wait, but in terms of σx, perhaps it's easier to compute using matrix multiplication.

So ψ is the column vector [a; b], σx is [[0 1],[1 0]], so σx |ψ⟩ would be [b; a ].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (a*, b*) × [ b ; a ] = a* b + b* a.

Which is 2 Re(a^* b) I think.

So a is 0.5, real, and b is sqrt(3)/2, also real. So a* = a, b* = b. So 2( a*b + a b )? Wait, a*, which is a, times b plus b* (a), which is also same as 2 (a b + b a) ? Hmmm, no, no, expression is a^* b + b^* a = 2 ab since a and b are real. So that's 2ab.

Let me compute a*b + b*a for real numbers a, b. So (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ). That is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 * 2 because the two terms add. So equals (sqrt(3)/2 ) * (0.5 ) *2? Wait, wait: expanding it, each term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2 ) + same, so 2 *0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (0.5)* sqrt(3). So sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is, sqrt(3) /2  ?

Wait but earlier when I wrote⟨σx⟩ in matrix terms it was 2ab.

Wait, looking again: a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab? Let's calculate: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4; times 2 gives sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, yes, ⟨σx⟩ equals sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait. So, putting this together:

The overall expectation value is 10 ⟨σz⟩ +5 ⟨σx⟩.

Which is 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2 ).

Calculate each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(√3/2 ) ≈ 5*(0.866) ≈4.33. Wait, 5*(sqrt(3)/2)=5*0.8660 approximately 4.3301.

Adding them: -5 + 4.3301 is approximately -0.6699, about -0.67.

Wait, but wait there's a confusion here. Because √3 is about 1.732, and√3/2 is approximately 0.866. 5 * 0.866 is around 4.33. Right.

Ah, so the total expectation is 10*(−0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5)+(4.33) = approximately -0.67.

Rounding to one decimal place. So -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

But wait the options show: 

A) -1.4 

B) 1.65 

C) -0.7 

D) 0.85 

Hence, the correct answer is C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1).
\]

Calculating each term:
- Probability of \( |\uparrow\rangle \): \( (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \),
- Probability of \( |\downarrow\rangle \): \( \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \).

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli-X matrix, which flips the spin states. Its expectation value for the given state is computed as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 \langle \uparrow|\sigma_x|\uparrow\rangle + |b|^2 \langle \downarrow|\sigma_x|\downarrow\rangle + a^*b \langle \uparrow|\sigma_x|\downarrow\rangle + ab^* \langle \downarrow|\sigma_x|\uparrow\rangle,
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( \sigma_x \) has off-diagonal elements and eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), the result simplifies to:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2\text{Re}(ab^*).
\]

Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total expectation value
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
