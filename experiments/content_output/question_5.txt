Question: Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? 

A) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)
B) (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin (\theta))â€¨
C) (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))

D) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2))

Assistant Response:
To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) of the operator \(\vec{P}\), we need to consider the \(Z\)-component of the operator \(\vec{P}\), since it directly corresponds to the \(\hbar/2\) eigenvalue.

Given that the \(Z\)-component is:
\[ P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]

We need to solve for the eigenvector \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\):

\[ P_z \vec{v} = \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ -v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} \]

This gives us the system of equations:
\[ \frac{\hbar}{2} v_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2} v_1 \]
\[ -\frac{\hbar}{2} v_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2} v_2 \]

The second equation simplifies to:
\[ -v_2 = v_2 \implies v_2 = 0 \]

So, \(v_2 = 0\) and \(v_1\) can be any non-zero value. To get the normalized eigenvector, we choose \(v_1 = 1\).

The normalized eigenvector is:
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \]

Expressed in the form provided in the options, this is:
\[ (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \]

Given that \(\theta/2 = 0\) (as \(v_2 = 0\)), we have \(\cos(0) = 1\) and \(\sin(0) = 0\).
