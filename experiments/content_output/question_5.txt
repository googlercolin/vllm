Okay, so I’m trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit stumped. Let me read through it carefully and see what I can figure out.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane, and we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, so I remember that for spin-½ particles, the operators are similar to the Pauli matrices, right? The Pauli matrices are for the spin operators in x, y, and z directions.

Wait, let me write down what I know. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of them is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me copy down the matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row (0 1) and second row (1 0). Oh wait, that’s the Pauli σx matrix. So Px = (ħ/2)σx. Similarly, Py is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which I think is the Pauli σy matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2)[ [1,0], [0,-1] ], so that would be σz.

So the operator P has components corresponding to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Therefore, this operator must be the spin angular momentum operator ħ/2 times the spin matrices.

Wait, wait. So normally, the spin operator along a direction n is given by S = ħ/2 (σ · n), right? So yeah. So the operator P here is for a spin along some direction, and we need to find its eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question says that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n could be any direction in the x-z plane. But the operator itself is given by components. Wait, or is the operator which components? Because S is usually Sx, Sy, Sz along their respective axes, but this operator could be along an arbitrary direction? Hmm. No—the components Px, Py, Pz are given, but the operator P (the vector) is in the direction n. So perhaps the operator we need to consider is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Wait, no, that's correct. The vector operator P in any direction n is the sum of P_i multiplied by components of n.

Wait, or perhaps P is the component operator along n. That is, the operator P could be represented as (P · n hat), where n hat is the unit vector in the arbitrary direction n laying in the x-z plane. So the operator would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in x-z, n_y = 0. So then P in the direction n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the question might just be asking about a general setup where direction is arbitrary but it's aligned along that n. So I think the actual operator we are to find the eigenvector for is P (acting along n). But from the given information, the potential problem could be that we maybe don't have actual numbers for n, but perhaps that's not needed because the eigenvector is in terms of an arbitrary direction's angles. Hmm, but the multiple choice options have variables like theta and phi, so maybe they want the eigenvector expressed in spherical coordinates or something.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the problem states that the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized by two angles perhaps? But for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, maybe θ varies from 0 to pi/2, because it's constrained to x-z. Hmm, so n would have components like (cos θ, 0, sin θ), if measured in angles θ from the z-axis, but being in the x-z plane implies that the direction doesn't have a y-component. Wait, or alternatively, from the x-z plane direction, but maybe the direction can be θ from the x-axis, in which case n would be (cos θ, 0, sin θ), but that's the same as starting from the z-axis no, perhaps not. Wait no, I need to think about it: if a vector lies in the x-z plane, it has components along x and z, but not y. So the polar angle θ (from the z-axis) and the azimuthal angle phi is zero or 180, etc. Because for any point in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the direction n in the x-z plane is at an angle θ from the x-axis and else on the plane, so that n = (cos φ, 0, sin φ), but since in x-z, phi =0 (or some other fixed value). Actually, perhaps phi isn't needed here because in the x-z plane, once θ is specified (the angle from the x-axis), then the direction is fixed as (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

Wait, but the eigenvalue for P (the component along n) is given as +ħ/2. So I'm note entirely sure if we're finding eigenvectors for each component (like Px, Popt Py, etc.) or for the operator P along direction n.

Maybe I need to clarify: The problem says "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."

So P is the operator for spin in the direction of n. Hence, the operator would be the combination Px, Py, Pz scaled by n_x, n_y, n_z. Since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, n has components (x, z) only. Wait no, wait n is a vector. A unit vector in the x-z plane would have components ax, 0, az; so that a = √(x² + z²) =1. Wait, but regardless, perhaps n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. Which would give n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Hmm, no, I think it's more standard to write it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), with θ measured from the x-axis.

Wait, typically, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So in that case, for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ will be 0 or π. Wait, if phi is zero, then the direction is in the x-z plane as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), with θ measured from zero along z. Wait, no, perhaps. Hmm. I'll have to consider later, but first, focus on obtaining the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler than this. Because when the direction is in the x-z plane, perhaps the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics or through a rotation of another known state, like the eigenstate from the x, y, or z directions.

Wait, let me think again. For spin-½ particles, the eigenvectors for spin along a direction n can be written in terms of rotations. Maybe it's easier to first consider the eigenstate of P along z, which is the known case.

For instance, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for S_z (scaled with ħ/2 in the operator) would correspond to the spin-up state, which in the basis |+z> is (1,0). Similarly, the eigenvector can be written as a superposition for any direction based on that.

But in this problem, the direction n is arbitrary along the x-z plane. So the eigenvector might be a superposition of the |+z> and |–z> states.

So for a general direction n, making angle θ from the z-axis and angle φ, which for our problem is 0 as it's in the x-z plane.

Wait no, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimutal angle phi is zero. So the unit vector would be (sinθ * cosφ, sinθ * sinphi, cosθ). But to be in x-z, sinphi must be zero. Because phi is azimutal angle in spherical coordinates, the angle around the z-axis. Wait, wait, but phi ranges from 0 to 2π, but for the x-z plane, the point where the direction of the vector is in the plane we have to think which component is non-zero. Let me consider that.

Ah, if a vector is pointing in the x-z plane, then it's at phi=0 or phi=π? Because let me think, in spherical coordinates, (r, theta, phi) corresponds to x = r sinθ cosphi, y = r sinθ sinphi, z= r cos theta. So in x-z plane, y=0, so sin phi =0 → phi=0. So the vector's direction will have phi=0 or pi. So n simplifies to (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, but then sinθ can be positive or negative, but the magnitude sqrt(x^2 + z^2) = sqrt{ (sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 }=1, so that works.

So the spin operator along n would be S · n = (Sx n_x + S_z n_z), since n_y=0. That operator is our operator P, given as:

P = (n_x P_x ) + (n_z P_z).

But since the components are in x and z, the operator is (n_x * (ħ/2 σx )) + (n_z (ħ/2 σz ))).

So to make this clear:

P = (ħ/2) [n_x σx + n_z σz].

Given that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, because when in the x-z plane, n = ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ). (Though I'm not 100% certain about theta's definition, but perhaps as the angle from the y-axis, but maybe from the x or z. Let me see, another way: if the direction is in the x-z plane then theta could be measured between the direction vector and the x-axis. So for n= (sinθ, 0, cosθ), theta=0 would point along x, and as theta increases to pi/2, n points along z.)

Wait, regardless, let's proceed. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0 1],
       [1 0]]
σz = [[1 0],
       [0 -1]]

So plugging into P:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0 1],[1 0]] + cosθ [[1 0],[0 -1]] ]

So, summarizing, P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:

[ cosθ    sinθ ]
[ sinθ   -cosθ ]

Because combining the matrices:

The top-left entry comes from cosθ * 1 (from σz) and nothing else since σx has zero there. The top-right is sinθ, etc.

So P is ħ/2 times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Therefore, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, we need to solve the equation: [ P ] |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, but one moment: P's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 multiplied by the maximum spin. Wait, the eigenvalues of the spin operator along any direction are ± ħ/2 for spin-½.

Setting the equation: (P - (ħ/2)I) |v> = 0.

Plugging in the matrix:

[ [cosθ * (ħ/2), (sinθ) ( ħ/2 ) ] 
 [ sinθ*(ħ/2     ),  (-cosθ) ( ħ/2 ) - ( ħ/2 ) ] ??? Hmm, no, perhaps I should approach it correctly.

Wait, the operator P is (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So and the equation (P - (ħ/2)I ) |v> = 0 → 

( (cosθ * ħ/2 - ħ/2 )  sinθ * ħ/2 )
( sinθ * ħ/2       (-cosθ ħ/2) - ħ/2 )

Wait, let's compute each matrix component:

Top-left: [ cosθ*(ħ/2) ) - ( eigenvalue = +ħ/2 ) ]

Wait wait, since the equation is (P - λ I)|v> =0, where λ is the eigenvalue. Oh wait, sure.

Wait, correct steps:

We have P|v> = λ |v>, because |v> is an eigenvector. So (P - λ I) |v> = 0.

We are looking for λ = +ħ/2.

Thus, P's matrix is given, so (P - (+ħ/2) I ) would be:

(ħ/2 ) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] 
 MINUS (+ħ/2) I.

So subtract ħ/2 in the diagonal terms:

The matrix becomes:

[ ( ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ] → scale ħ/2 factors are common.

Divide every component by ħ/2 (since it's a common factor):

Matrix becomes:

[ cosθ -1,               sinθ           ]
[  sinθ,           -cosθ -1 ]

Wait, wait no: (P - (lambda I)) = (ħ/2) ( matrix ) - (lambda) I.

Since lambda is +ħ/2, then:

Matrix for (P - lambda I) = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] − [ [ħ/2, 0 ], [0, ħ/2 ] ].

So each diagonal term is (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), non-diagonal are sinθ ħ/2.

So the entire matrix is:

First row: (ħ/2 (cosθ - 1),   (ħ/2) sinθ )
Second row: ( (ħ/2) sinθ,      (ħ/2 (-cosθ - 1 )) )

So factor out ħ/2 from all terms:

[ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ] multiplied by ( ħ/2 ), etc.

But to find the kernel of this matrix (i.e., solutions to (P - lambda I)|v> =0 ), we can write the matrix without the constant factor and set it to have determinant zero. So the system becomes:

(cosθ - 1) * v1 + sinθ * v2 =0
sinθ * v1 + ( -cosθ -1 ) v2 =0

We only need the non-trivial solution, so writing for homogeneous equations, the determinant must be zero.

But perhaps find the eigenvector by solving any rows.

So from the first equation:

( cosθ - 1 )v1 + sinθ v2 =0 → [Equation 1]

Similarly, second equation:

sinθ v1 + ( -cosθ -1 ) v2 =0 → [Equation 2]

Now, from equation 1: (cosθ −1 )v1 = − sinθ v2 → v1 = [ - sinθ / ( cosθ − 1 ) ] v2

Hmmm. Let me also factor the denominator cosθ–1= - (1 – cosθ )

So v1 = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 – cosθ) ) ] v2 → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 – cosθ) ) ] v2

We can also multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

sinθ / ( 1 – cosθ ) = [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ) / ( (1 – cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ) ]
= [ sinθ (1+cosθ) ) ] / (1 – cos²θ )
But 1 – cos²θ = sin²θ, so this reduces to [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ) ] / sin²theta ) 
= (1 + cosθ) / sinθ.

So v1= ( (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ) * v2.

Let me set v2 = 1. Then v1 = (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ. 

So the eigenvector is ( (1 + cosθ)/sinθ , 1 ), multiplied by some normalization.

But let me think if that's correct.

Wait, the other approach is to express the vector and see if plug into the second equation.

Equation 2: sintheta*v1 + (- costheta -1 )v2=0.

Substituting v1 from equation 1: v1 = [ ( sintheta ) / ( 1 – costheta ) ) ] v2^*( sign-wise? Not sure needed, but proceeding) Plug into equation 2.

Wait, perhaps I should instead test the simplified solution.

Say v = ( a, 1 ), and use equation 1 to compute a.

But perhaps this is getting a bit too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the eigenvector in a more manageable form, like through spherical coordinates.

Wait, knowing that the spin states can be represented by spherical harmonics, with the |+n> and |-n> states. The eigenvectors are along the direction n, and perhaps represented such.

The standard formula for the eigenstates along a direction n, with parameters theta and phi, would be:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

|–n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2 ) ]

But since our direction n is in the x-z plane, as before, phi=0, so e^{-i 0} = 1. So the state becomes:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

|–n> = [ - sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]

Wait, but in this case, when phi=0, the state simplifies. So thinking about what theta parameter we're referring. Let me define theta as angle from the z-axis.

But wait, earlier we had n_x = sintheta, but for the spin along n, the eigenvector would be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), perhaps with some multiplicative phase. Because when n is along z, theta=0, giving |+z> = (1, 0 ), which matches our expected state. Alternatively, if n is along x, theta=pi/2, sin(theta/2)=1, so the state becomes (0,1), which is also correct.

But that would make sense. So perhaps the eigenvector is indeed ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), without the phase, given that phi=0. And since it's normalized, that is the case.

Looking at the options given, option C is (\cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2 )), which would match the state I just wrote, but without considering any phase or other factors.

But wait, the options include an option with hbar – do they have ħ in the components?

In our case, the eigenvectors shouldn't have units, because vectors for any directions are dimensionless, with the only factors being the angles. So the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), both dimensionless, same as a state vector.

In the options, A is (sqrt(2/3) ħ , sqrt(1/3) ħ ), which includes hbar, which is unit, which seems fishy. Wait, the options don't make much sense in terms of normalization—normalization would require that the sum of squares be 1. In option A, each element has ħ. So ( sqrt(2/3) ħ )^2 + (sqrt(1/3) ħ )^2 = (2/3 ħ² ) + (1/3 ħ² ) = ħ², which is not 1. That's an issue because eigenvectors must be normalized. So unless there's a scaling factor elsewhere.

Wait no, maybe the vectors are not normalized. But the question says 'the normalized eigenvector', so they should have their vectors with respective elements summing to 1 in magnitude squared.

Wait, let's check option B: elements (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta ). If that's the case, then magnitude squared is cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta = 1. So yes, they're normalized as a unit vector in 2 components.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2 )) for eigenvector components. Their squares sum to cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1. So that also is a normalized state.

Wait, but wait a second—another aspect: the Pauli matrices are 2x2; their eigenvectors can be written but sometimes require careful normalization, but in this case, both |+n> and |-n> are normalized.

Therefore, the correct state would have components ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ). So option C says exactly that.

Wait, looking at the options given:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, let me check another way. When we derived from the eigenstate equation earlier, we had v1 = ( (1 + cos θ)/ sin θ ) * v2. Let me take v2 = 1.

So v1= (1 + cos θ ) / sin θ. 

Expressed as v = [ ( 1 + cos theta ) / sin theta , 1 ]

Let me see what that is when theta=0 (along z-axis). Then sin theta is zero. Oh, that's a problem. So the previous method when theta is zero is along z, the earlier expression would lead to a division by zero.

Alternative approach: Why take that approach? Since the solution with spin up along n is simply expressed, perhaps a smarter way is to realize that the eigenvector should be given in terms of a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states for that direction, which, in the basis, is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ), as I earlier thought.

Alternatively, let's do a test case. Suppose n is along x direction. So theta=90 degrees, pi/2 radians from the z-axis. Then theta/2=pi/4.

Thus, the state would be ( cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4 )) = ( sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ), which is a symmetric state.

Similarly, for spin up in the x-direction, this is correct.

But wait, in the x-direction, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the state (1,1) or (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) would indeed be the eigenstate whose eigenstate is (1,1) normalized, as (1/sqrt(2)) (1,1) corresponds to up in x.

So option C works in this case.

But wait, what about when n is along z: theta=0. Therefore theta/2=0.

The state is (1, 0 ), which is correct.

And when theta=pi (along negative z), the state would be ( 0,1 ), which is correct because spining down along negative z (but since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps other implications, but n being along –z direction: perhaps confused with eigenvalue.

Wait, but according to the original question, n is in the x-z plane, which includes the negative z direction? So not folding the actual eigenvalues into which states, but the general case regardless.

Another test case: n is along the positive z, which gives the correct eigenstate as (1,0).

So in all these cases, the state ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) works, so option C is correct.

Another approach: The general spin-1/2 system eigenvector for spin up along an axis n with polar angle θ (from z-axis) and phi=0 is:

|+n> = ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

Since phi=0 here, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively, scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, allowing it to be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation $(P - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$ is solved, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
[\cos\theta - 1]v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \\
\sin\theta v_1 + [-\cos\theta - 1]v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, $v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms the solution. Choosing $v_2 = 1$, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
v = \left( \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta}, 1 \right).
\]

Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:

\[
v = \left( \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta}, 1 \right).
\]

Further simplification shows that the eigenvector can be expressed as:

\[
v = \left( \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2} \right),
\]

which is normalized since $\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2} + \sin^2\frac{\theta}{2} = 1$. This matches the standard form of the spin-½ eigenstate for spin-up along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is normalized but does not match the derived eigenvector structure.
- **Option C**: $(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is consistent with the spin-½ eigenstate for spin-up along $\vec{n}$.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ includes $\hbar$ and additional coefficients, which are inconsistent with the derived normalized eigenvector.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
