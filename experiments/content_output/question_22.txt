Question: A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:
Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.
Which combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

Assistant Response:
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the behavior of oxygen in both basic and acidic solutions from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives.

1. **Thermodynamics in Basic Solutions:**
   - In basic solutions, the reduction potential of oxygen to form water is more favorable due to the presence of hydroxide ions (OH-). This makes oxygen a stronger oxidant in basic solutions because it can readily accept electrons to form hydrogen peroxide or other oxidized species.

2. **Kinetics in Acidic Solutions:**
   - In acidic solutions, the reaction of oxygen is slower compared to basic solutions. This is because the activation energy for the reaction of oxygen in acidic conditions is higher, meaning that it requires more energy for oxygen to react.

Based on this analysis, the correct statement is that oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions and reacts slower in acidic solutions.

Thus, the correct combination is:

Answer: B
