Question: The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.
A) 9.5*1e4 GeV
B) 1.8*1e5 GeV
C) 2.6*1e5 GeV
D) 3.9*1e5 GeV

Assistant Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the condition under which the annihilation $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ becomes significant. The annihilation of a high-energy gamma ray ($\gamma$) with a CMB photon is feasible when the total energy of the two photons is at least equal to the energy required to create an electron-positron pair, which is $2m_ec^2$. Here, $m_e$ is the mass of an electron, approximately $0.511$ MeV or $5.11 \times 10^{-4}$ eV.

The threshold energy for this process is:
\[
2m_ec^2 = 2 \times 5.11 \times 10^{-4} \text{ eV} \approx 1.022 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV}
\]

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is on the order of $10^{-3}$ eV, the interaction will become significant when the $\gamma$-ray energy is much higher. The total energy of the two photons must be just above the threshold energy.

Assuming linear scaling with energy, the $\gamma$-ray should have an energy that is significantly higher than the CMB photon energy to ensure a successful interaction. Therefore, the $\gamma$-ray should be at least several times the average energy of the CMB photon. A rough estimate shows that:

\[
\gamma \text{ energy} \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \approx 5000 \times 10^3 \text{ eV} = 5 \times 10^6 \text{ eV} = 5 \text{ MeV}
\]

However, we need to look at the options provided and see which one fits the condition best. The options are in GeV, so converting 5 MeV to GeV (where 1 GeV = $10^3$ MeV), we get approximately 5000 MeV or 5 GeV. For the annihilation process to dominate, we need the energy to be significantly higher, closer to the order of $1.022 \times 10^5$ eV, which is about $102.2$ GeV.

Analyzing the options provided:

A) 9.5*1e4 GeV = 95,000 GeV
B) 1.8*1e5 GeV = 180,000 GeV
C) 2.6*1e5 GeV = 260,000 GeV
D) 3.9*1e5 GeV = 390,000 GeV

The energy required for significant annihilation interactions is around 100 GeV, which is closest to option B at 180,000 GeV.

Answer: B
