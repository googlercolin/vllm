Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about high-energy gamma-rays interacting with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is about determining at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime is limited by the process gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. 

Hmm, let me think. So, the process in question is when a high-energy gamma-ray photon interacts with a CMB photon to produce an electron and a positron. This process is called photon-photon annihilation, right? I remember that the cross-section for this process increases at certain energies. Also, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the probability of this interaction becomes significant in the universe.

Wait, but gamma-rays with very high energies might interact with the CMB photons more often, causing them to lose energy or disappear quickly. So, the lifetime is related to the mean free path of these gamma-rays before they annihilate. If the mean free path is short compared to the size of the universe, their effective lifetime would be shorter.

I should recall the formula for the photon-photon interaction cross-section. I think the cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- increases with energy but there's a certain threshold. Wait, the Klein-Nishina formula deals with high energies where the cross-section starts to rise. For very high photon energies E, the cross-section σ can be approximated. 

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to think about the energy at which the photon-photon interaction rate equals the inverse age of the universe or something like that. Wait, the problem is considering the limit where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, so we might use the mean lifetime formula.

I've heard about the calculation for the GZK limit. Oh right! The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit describes the energy beyond which high-energy cosmic protons (or particles) collide with CMB photons to produce pions, limiting their flux. But, I'm not sure if the approach is the same here since the question is about photons, not protons.

Wait, so the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation σ is a function of the energy of the gamma-ray. I think the cross-section for γγ → e+e− is proportional to (E γ)^2 * some function. But perhaps a more precise approach would be to look up the typical formula or derive it.

The formula, I think, for the mean free path λ of a gamma-ray photon in the CMB is given by λ ≈ (n_γ σ)^-1, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons and σ is the cross-section. 

The number density n_γ for the CMB is known. I remember the current CMB density is roughly n_γ ≈ 411 photons/cm³. Wait, but in terms of eV and inverse meters, perhaps I should remember it in particle per energy in some units.

Wait, alternatively, using the relationship with the CMB temperature. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, so the average energy per photon is roughly kT ≈ 0.0027 eV (since 1 K is about 8.617e-5 eV), so it's about (maybe 1e-3 eV, which matches the given data in the problem statement).

So the CMB photon number density is n_γ ≈ (energy flux) or using the blackbody formula. Another approach: The CMB photon density is given by the integral over the blackbody spectrum, but it's n_γ ~ (E_cmb)^3 / (3 (k T)^4) ). But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, the photon energy here is given as 1e-3 eV. So I can use this value directly. Let me start deriving the formula.

The cross-section σ for γ + photon → e+ + e− is given when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is sufficient to create the electron-positron pair. The threshold energy is when the product of the two photon energies equals (2 m_e c² )^2. Wait, but since one photon is from the CMB (with energy around 1e-3 eV) and the other is a gamma-ray with energy Eγ, the condition is Eγ * E_cmbr ≥ (m_e c²)^2. But m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV.

Wait, no, the threshold occurs when the combined energy in the CM frame is enough to produce the rest mass energy of the particles. For e+e-, the ≥ would be ( sqrt(s) ) = 2 m_e c² ), so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 gamma something. But perhaps I can make an approximation.

Wait, in the center-of-mass frame: in the lab frame, it's two photons colliding. Let me think frame'invariance. The invariant squared s is s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c )^2.

But photons have E = |p| c, so E_γ = |pγ| c, E_cmbr = |p_cmb| c. So,

s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ^2 + E_cmb^2 + 2 E_γ E_cmb cosθ) )

Wait, cosθ... because the momenta are not necessarily in the same direction. Hmm wait, but for the purpose of threshold, like for maximum possible energy, or when the photons are head-on (so cosθ = -1, adding their momenta opposite), which gives the minimum condition? So in the "worst case," we can take the case when the photons are moving directly opposite each other, θ = 180 degrees. 

But perhaps there's a simpler approach. The invariant s is ((p1 + p2)μ)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. 

Expanding: (E1 + E2)^2 - c^2 (p1 + p2)^2.

Remembering that for each photon, E=pc c? Wait, not exactly, since for photons, E = pc. So for each photon, p = E/(c). So, for photon 1, p1 c = E1.

But wait, better is to compute it in terms of E's and θ, maybe. For simplicity, consider when the two photons move in opposite directions; the cross-section is maximized, so perhaps using that condition for the threshold.

So let's do that.

s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - [ (E_γ^2 + E_cmb^2 + 2 E_γ E_cmb cosθ ) ]

Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, θ is 180 degrees. So cosθ = -1.

s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - [ E_γ^2 + E_cmb^2 - 2 E_γ E_cmb ].

Because (p1 + p2)^2 when theta is 180 would be ( |p1 c| - |p2 c| )^2 = p1²c² + p2²c² - 2 p1 p2 c². Wait, perhaps better to compute that term.

Wait, perhaps using vectors: (p1 c· + p2 c·) ... since they're in opposite directions and |p| is |E/(c²) c|, yeah, but perhaps the dot product between p1 c and p2 c is - |p1| c |p2| c. Because momentum vectors are opposite.

Wait, I've gotten a bit stuck in a loop here, but perhaps an alternative approach works. For photons moving in opposite directions, their 3-momenta are in opposite vectors. So the total 3-moment is |p1 - p2| (since they're opposite directions: p1 = magnitude, p2 = - magnitude). So:

s = ( E_γ + E_cmb )^2 - ( (p_γ - p_cmb) c )^2 c^2. 

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should set s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1 c - p2 c| )^2. 

So, E1 is high-energy gamma, E2 is CMB photon. p1 is E1/(c), p2 is E2/(c).

Wait, the invariant squared s must be (sqrt(s))^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (c (p1 + p2 ))^2, but I'm getting stuck. Let me see:

The standard formula for the square of the center of mass energy in a two-body (photon, photon) collision is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (c^2) (p1 + p2)^2.

But for photons, p = E/c, so p1 = E1 / (c^2 c), no: eigenvectors: time often, wait, perhaps better to normalize consistently.

Each photon has E = |p| c, so p = E/(c^2) units? No, sorry, E is in Joules, p in kg·m/s, so E = pc c → p = E/(c^2). So |p| = E/(c^2) * c → Ah, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute more carefully.

Energy and momentum for photons: E_photon = p_photon * c → p_photon = E_photon / c^2? Wait no, because E = hf and p = h f/c → E = p c. So yes, p = E / c.

So for each photon, its momentum is E/c.

So E_photon = (c)(momentum)

Now, substituting into s:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - [ ( (E1/c) + (E2/c) ) c ]^2.

Wait, the [ vector ] is sqrt( (E1/c + E2/c) ) * c ?

No, I'm not accounting for directions correctly. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are p1 = E1/c, and p2 = - E2/c (assuming E2 is the other photon, say the CMB photon's momentum is in opposite direction). Or, another approach: their vectors are p1 (from gamma-ray) and p2 (from CMB) which are in opposite directions, so their vector sum is p1 - p2.

But perhaps computing s in a situation where both photons are moving towards each other. So maybe |p1| = Eγ / c, and |p2|=Ecmb /c. Then their 3-momenta are opposite, so the magnitude is |p_total| = | |p1| - |p2| |, but direction doesn't matter.

Wait, no. Since vectors, when you add p1 (from gamma) and p2 (from CMB which is moving in opposite direction), the magnitude is |p1 - p2| if they are in straight line opposite directions. So the square of the sum is (p1 - p2)^2.

Putting this into s:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1/c - E2/c) * c )]^2.

Simplify: 

= (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expand both terms:

E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2² - (E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2² )

= E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2² - E1² + 2 E1 E2 - E2².

= [ (E1² - E1²) ) + (E2² - E2²) ) + (2 E1 E2 + 2 E1 E2) ) ]

Which is 4 E1 E2 (*Considering that it was E1 + E2 in the first term and E1 - E2 in the second term, but wait, when I switched to perpendicular motion, perhaps theta not 180; no, perhaps no because we considered opposite directions (theta=180) for the maximum cross-section.)

So, wait, in the scenario where the two photons are colliding head-on, the maximum possible energy is achieved, so s = ( E1 + E2 )^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2 = 4 E1 E2.

Wait, what? Because [ (E1 - E2) ] squared is E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2. Then, (E_total)^2 is E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2. So, when I subtract, its (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - ( E1^2 -2 E1 E2 + E2^2 ) = 4 E1 E2. So yes, s =4 E1 E2. 

Ah, okay. Because we're considering photons moving in opposite directions, which gives the maximum possible center of mass energy. So s= (2 E_cm)^2= s? No, the minimum? Hmm, perhaps in all directions, but this calculation is threshold for the process to happen.

The minimum s needed for e+ e- production is (2 m_e c^2 )^2. Because each particle has energy m_e c^2, so the combined is 2 m_e c^2.

So, 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2 )^2 → Now, m_e is the electron mass.

So,

4 Eγ E_cmb = (2 m_e c² )² → 

So,

Eγ * E_cmb = (4 ( m_e^2 c^4 )) / 4 ) → which is m_e² c^4. Hmm,

Wait,

(2 m_e c^2 )^2 = 4 m_e² c^4. So,

4 Eγ E_cmb = (2 m_e c² )² → 4 Eγ E_cmb = 4 m_e² c^4 → 
Eγ E_cmb = m_e^2 c^4.

We don't have to worry about units yet, but let's compute the value. Since E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV. e= elementary charge, but here, perhaps it's better to use eV as the unit throughout.

Wait, units can be a bit tricky here. Let me compute in eV. m_e c^2 is approximately 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV.

So,

Eγ = ( m_e c² )² / E_cmb.

Then, plug the numbers:

Eγ = ( (511,000 eV )^2 ) / ( 1e-3 eV ) → Let's compute that:

(5e5 eV)^2 is 25e10 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV → (25e10) / (1e-3) ) = 25e13 eV.

Wait, let me compute in exponents:

511,000 = 5.11e5 eV.

So (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 × 10^10 = approx 26.11 ×1e10 → 2.611e11 eV².

Divided by 1e-3 eV: (2.611e11) / (1e-3) ) → 2.611e14 eV → which is 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but 1 TeV is 1e12 eV. So, 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV or 260000 GeV → 2.6×10^5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6×1e5 GeV, which is 260,000 GeV, same as 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, the options are:

A) 9.5e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV

B) 1.8e5 GeV → 180,000 GeV

C)2.6e5 GeV →260,000 GeV

D)3.9e5 GeV→ 390,000 GeV.

But our calculation gives exactly 2.6e5 GeV, so option C.

But wait, so is this the energy where the cross-section becomes significant? Or, actually, this is the threshold for the process to happen. But the question is about the energy where the gamma's lifetime is limited—presumably because they annihilate with CMB photons. So, above that energy, the gamma photons would annihilate more quickly, thus their lifetime is limited.

Thus, the answer should be option C. So perhaps, the correct option is C, 2.6*1e5 GeV.

Wait, perhaps another check. The cross-section increases significantly above the threshold, so when Eγ is above that threshold, photon-photon interactions become more probable, leading to shorter mean lifetimes because the mean free path becomes small compared to the universe's size.

Another way to think is to compute the mean free path and then equate it to the Hubble length (or universe size) divided by the age. But perhaps this approach gets more complex.

Alternatively, using annihilation cross-section and optical depth. When the optical depth τ ≈ 1, the probability of interaction is about 63%. So,

τ = n_γ * σ * λ_0,

where λ_0 is the mean free path. Wait, generally, τ = n × σ × L, where L is the distance traveled.

But in the case of cosmic gamma-rays—this can be applied. If the universe's size is about 10^28 km, or something like that, but perhaps I can use the年龄 ..

Alternatively, the condition is that the time until annihilation is comparable to the age of the universe, about 1e10 years.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the cross-section becomes important when gamma-rays are above a certain energy, Eγ, so that their lifetime (distance they can travel before annihilating) is comparable to the universe's size. Therefore, when the cross-section is such that τ=1 (optical depth 1), then the mean lifetime is limited.

Another approach that uses the mean free path:

 lifetime = c * age_of_universe ≈ c * 10^18 seconds.

Wait, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is around 4.3e17 seconds (since 1 billion = 1e9, 1 year is ~3e7 seconds, so 13.8e9 *3e7= 4.14e17 seconds).

The mean free path λ = 1/(n_γ * σ).

So, the probability of annihilation P is 1 - e^{- n_γ σ λ ). For P ~63%, we have nσλ ≈1. 

But if I assume, for τ=1, so gamma will annihilate once in an average traversal. So n_γ * σ * L ≈ 1.

Here, L is the distance gamma travels before annihilating, which should be the mean free path. So, L = 1/(n σ ) * [n σ L =1 → n σ L =1 → asnongravity terms, perhaps.

Wait, but in terms of age of universe, distance c times age t. So:

L =c t → if the gamma is to have significant interactions, L should make  n_gamma * sigma * c t = O(1) → which is tau = O(1).

But maybe in this problem, we can relate things to t.

But I think perhaps the initial approach, the threshold was to calculate Egamma such that 4 Egamma E_cmb = (2 m_e c^2 )^2. So with E_cmb=1e-3 eV, m_e c^2 = ~0.511 MeV. So Egamma equals (m_ec²)^2 / (4 E_cmb) → Wait, no, from previous calculation, Egamma = (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_cmb).

Because after the algebra: Egamma * E_cmb= m_e² c^4 → as above.

So that leads us to Egamma = (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

Which for m_ec²=511e3 eV (0.511 MeV), and E_cmb=1e-3 eV:

Egamma = (5.11e5 eV )^2 / (1e-3 eV) → which is (5.11e5)^2 = ~2.6e11 eV², divided by 1e-3 eV is 2.6e14 eV. 1e14 eV is 1e2 GeV → 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e2 GeV → no, wait, 1e9 eV is 1 GeV → So 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e5 GeV.

So this matches with option C. 

But wait, in the problem statement, it says: from what energy would the gamma-rays have their lifetime limited. That would happen when photons have sufficient energy to interact with the CMB, because higher energy photons would have a higher cross-section and thus shorter mean free path.

Therefore, the limiting energy is the one where the photon-photon cross-section becomes sufficient to limit the photon's lifetime, which is presumably the threshold we've just calculated. Hence, the correct answer is C.
</think>

To determine the energy at which the lifetimes of high-energy gamma-rays are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ due to interactions with CMB photons, we analyze the photon-photon cross-section and the threshold energy for this process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Threshold Energy for Annihilation**:  
   The process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ requires that the center-of-mass energy in the $\gamma\gamma$ collision is at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. For two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (high-energy gamma-ray) and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ (CMB photon), the invariant squared energy $s$ is given by:
   \[
   s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}
   \]
   Setting $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, the threshold energy for $E_\gamma$ is:
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Substituting Known Values**:  
   - The energy of the CMB photon is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$.  
   - The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$.  

   Substituting these values:
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{(2 \times 511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
   \]
   Compute the numerator:
   \[
   (2 \times 511,000)^2 = (1,022,000)^2 = 1.044 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2
   \]
   Divide by the denominator:
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{1.044 \times 10^{12}}{4 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Convert to GeV**:  
   Since $1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$, we convert:
   \[
   E_\gamma = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Interpretation**:  
   This energy corresponds to the threshold where the annihilation process becomes significant. At this point, the mean free path of the gamma-ray in the CMB becomes small enough to limit its lifetime in the universe. For energies above this threshold, the interaction probability increases, leading to a shorter effective lifetime for the gamma-ray.

### Conclusion:
The energy at which the lifetimes of gamma-rays are limited by the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This matches option **C**.
