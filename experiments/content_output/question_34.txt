Question: "1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.
For the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?
3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B
1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C
A) A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
B) A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
C) A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
D) A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one

Assistant Response:
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the Pinacol rearrangement process and apply it to each compound given.

### Pinacol Pinacolone Rearrangement:
1. The Pinacol rearrangement involves the conversion of a vicinal diol (a diol molecule where the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons) to an carbonyl compound.
2. Each vicinal diol gives rise to a ketone or aldehyde via elimination of a water molecule.
3. The stereochemistry can change during the rearrangement, but the key point is that an alcohol group adjacent to an oxygen in the rearranged structure will be converted to a ketone (or an aldehyde).

### Analyzing the Compounds:

#### Compound (A): 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
- The key diol here is at positions 3 and 4.
- After rearrangement, the hydroxyl group adjacent to the ketone will undergo a change in position and could result in a 2-pentanone structure (since the terminal carbon gets shifted).
- The methyl group will remain, and the phenyl group will also remain.
- Thus, the product is likely to be 3-methyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one (A).

#### Compound (B): 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
- The key diol is at positions 2 and 3.
- After rearrangement, the hydroxyl group adjacent to the ketone will result in a 1-butanone structure.
- The 4-hydroxyphenyl group and the phenyl group will remain.
- Thus, the product is likely to be 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one (B).

#### Compound (C): 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
- The key diol is at positions 1 and 2.
- After rearrangement, the hydroxyl group adjacent to the ketone will result in a 1-alkane structure (since the terminal carbon gets shifted).
- With three 4-methoxyphenyl groups and one phenyl group, the product will retain these functionalities.
- Thus, the product is likely to be 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one (C).

### Conclusion:
- A = 3-methyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one
- B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one
- C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one

Therefore, the correct option is:

Answer: C
