Question: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?
A) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol

Assistant Response:
To determine the structure of product 4, let's follow the transformations step by step:

1. **Initial Compound (1) to Product 2**: Compound 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming a Grignard reaction with subsequent alkylation. This introduces a benzyl group (-C6H5CH2-) to the compound.

2. **Product 2 to Product 3**: Product 2 is treated with LDA (Lithium Diisopropylamide) and iodomethane, leading to the formation of a secondary alcohol. The methylene group attached to a carbon that already has an alkyl or benzyl group (from the previous step) will be converted into an alkoxy group (-OCH3).

3. **Product 3 to Product 4**: Finally, product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl, which should protonate the hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a benzyl ether and an alcohol group. However, the structure provided in the question implies a more complex transformation leading to a different product.

Given the context and the provided structures, the final transformation suggested is converting the alkoxy to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group by reacting with HCl, resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid with the oxygen in a different position than the original alcohol group.

By reviewing the options, the correct structure that matches the described transformations is:

A) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
