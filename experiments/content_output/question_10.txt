Question: Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.
A) d
B) a
C) c
D) b

Assistant Response:
To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to use the formula for density: density = mass/volume.

For a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet, the density is approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 because it is composed in a similar manner to Earth.

For b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3, the volume would be the same as 2 Earths, making the density lower than 5.5 g/cm^3.

For c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth, the density would be higher than Earth's because its mass is greater but its volume (radius cubed) is not necessarily changing proportionately.

For d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth, the density would be lower than Earth's because the mass is less.

The planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would have a higher density than an Earth-mass planet, as the volume would scale by a factor less than 5 (since volume is a function of the cube of the radius, and assuming volume increases linearly with mass for these purposes).

Answer: C
