Question: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?
A) Red
B) Violet
C) Blue
D) Yellow

Assistant Response:
To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound based on the given energy of 2.3393 eV, we can use the relationship between photon energy and wavelength. The energy \( E \) of a photon is given by the equation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}\)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

First, let's convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) using the conversion \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\):

\[ E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.747 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \]

Now, rearrange the equation to solve for wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \]

Plug in the values:

\[ \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{3.747 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \]

\[ \lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{m}}{3.747 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \]

\[ \lambda \approx 5.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \]

Convert the wavelength to nanometers (1 nm = \(10^{-9}\) m):

\[ \lambda \approx 530 \, \text{nm} \]

Wavelength 530 nm corresponds to green light. However, the options provided are for complementary colors. Among the given options, the color complementary to green is violet.
