Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic particles. Let me read it carefully.

So the question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, lithium normally has 3 protons and some neutrons. If it's a nucleus with 3 neutrons, then let me think—lithium has atomic number 3, so if there's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, right?

Wait, but wait a second. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So that would make X as Li-6. Ok, so I'll need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, relativistic effects are definitely important. The energy will be the total relativistic energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)). 

So to find gamma, I can plug in v = 0.96c.

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c^2, which is 0.9216 c^2. 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let's calculate that.

1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 0.28 times 3.5714—if I get 1. So 3.5714 * 0.28 = 1? Hmm; 3*0.28=0.84, 0.5714*0.28 is about 0.16 (0.16). 0.84+0.16=1. Exactly. So yes, gamma is 3.5714.

Wait wait, but I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me think: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784...

Wait, I know that 0.28^2 is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28. Let me think: 0.2 *0.2=0.04, 0.08*0.08=0.0064, but wait, that's not the right way to calc. 0.28^2 is (28 x 28) in 10,000ths.

28*28 =784. Oh wait, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So yeah, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857.

Now, the next step is to compute the energy in GeV. But we need the rest mass energy, and then multiply by gamma.

To find m0 c^2 for a Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. We can calculate its mass based on the binding energy or use the atomic mass.

But probably, the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a lithium-6 nucleus, which I can get from a table. Wait, I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0139 g/mol... but wait, I need it in GeV.

Wait, let's clarify: 1 u (atomic mass unit) is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So I can compute the mass in GeV/c² by converting from atomic mass.

So, for Lithium-6:

The molar mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0139 atomic mass units (u). So each nucleus has mass 6.0139 u.

So converting that to GeV/c²:

Multiply 6.0139 by 0.9315 GeV/u.

Let me compute that:

6.0139 × 0.9315 ≈ Let's do that step by step.

First, 6 ×0.9315 = 5.589.

Then, 0.0139 ×0.9315 ≈0.013 (approximate? Or more accurately: 0.0139 * 0.9315.

Compute 0.01 ×0.9315=0.009315.

0.0039*0.9315: about 0.00363285.

So 0.009315 + 0.00363285=0.01294785.

So total ≈5.589 + 0.01294785 ≈5.60195 GeV/c².

Wait no, wait. The mass number is 6, but that includes protons and neutrons.

Wait no, wait, the atomic mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.0139 u. So the rest energy is m₀ c² =6.0139 u * (0.9315 GeV/u) ≈5.602 GeV.

So m₀ c² is approximately 5.60195 GeV.

Wait, wait but no. Wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 931.5 MeV ≈ 0.9315 GeV. So yes, 6.0139 u is about 5.602 GeV.

OK, so the rest mass energy is m₀ c² ≈5.602 GeV.

Wait, but let me get that exact: 6.0139 multiplied by 0.9315.

Calculating 6.0139 ×0.9315:

Break it down: 

6.0139 × 0.9 = 5.41251
6.0139 ×0.03=0.180417
6.0139 ×0.0015=0.00902085.

Adding them up: 5.41251 +0.180417=5.592927. Plus 0.00902085=5.60194785 GeV.

Ok, so m0 c² ≈5.6019 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by m0 c².

Gamma we found was 3.5714.

So E= gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.6019 GeV.

Now, let's compute that.

Multiplying these together: 3.5714 ×5.6019.

Hmm, let me approximate with more steps.

First, break 3.5714 into 3 +0.5 +0.0714.

Wait, alternatively, calculate 3.5 ×5.6 is 19.6, and then adjust for the additional terms.

Wait, 3.5714 ×5 =17.857

3.5714 ×0.6019 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, to sum up, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 3.5714×5.6019 directly.

So, 3.5714 ×5.6019.

Approximately: 3.5714×5=17.857. 3.5714*0.6=2.14284. 3.5714 *0.0019≈0.006785, sum total 17.857 +2.14284 =20 approx, then + 0.006785 gives about 19.9997, wait, wait, no that's not correct. Wait I think I messed up the division. Let me compute it properly.

Another approach: 3.5714 multiplied by 5 is 17.857.

Then 3.5714 multiplied by 0.6019.

Wait, so 3.5714 ×0.6=2.14284.

3.5714×0.0019= 3.5714 *0.002= approximately 0.0071428... but it's less since it's 0.0019 instead of 0.002. so 3.5714 ×0.0019 = 0.00678566.

So sum:

3.5714 *5.6019 =17.857 (from 5) + (3.5714 *0.6019 )=3.5714*(0.6+0.0019) =3.5714*.6=2.1428; 3.5714*.0019=0.006785.

So 2.1428 +0.006785=2.149585.

Then total E is 17.857 +2.149585 =19.997 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20 GeV. Hmm. That seems a bit too round.

Wait, perhaps there was a computational error. Let's use another method.

Using calculator-like steps:

Multiply 3.5714 and 5.6019.

Breakdown 5.6019 as 5 + 0.6 +0.0019.

But perhaps it's easier to do it manually another way.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.6019 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 ×5.6019 step by step.

= (3 +0.5 +0.0714) *5.6019

=3*5.6019 +0.5*5.6019 +0.0714*5.6019

3*5.6019 =16.8057

0.5*5.6019=2.80095

0.0714*5.6019 ≈?

5.6019 *0.07 is 0.392133; 5.6019 *0.0014=approx 0.00784266. So total about 0.3999753.

Now, adding all three parts:

16.8057 + 2.80095 =19.60665.

Plus 0.3999753 ≈19.60665 +0.3999753 =20.006625.

Hmm, so around 20.0066 GeV.

But wait, the choices are given to four decimal places, like option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419, but options are A to D.

Wait, looking at the problem again, the choices are A:18.475, B:23.069, C:20.132, D:21.419 GeV.

Our computation gives around 20.0066 GeV.

But none of the options is exactly that. Hmm, why?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the gamma and the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass.

Wait, the molar mass of Lithium-6 is 6.0139 u. So m0=6.0139 u.

Convert it to GeV/c²: 

m0 c² =6.0139 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6 *931.5 MeV =5589 MeV, but plus (0.0139 *931.5) MeV.

Wait, 931.5 MeV/u times 6 u is 5589 MeV (so that's 5.589 GeV).

Then, 931.5 *0.0139:

931.5 * 0.01 =9.315 → 0.00, 931.5*0.0039≈3.63285.

So 9.315 +3.63285=12.94785 MeV, which is 0.01294785 GeV.

So 5.589 GeV + 0.01294785 GeV =5.60195 GeV, so that part is correct.

So gamma is 3.5714; 3.5714 *5.60195 ≈?

Let me compute 3.5714 ×5.60195 accurately.

3.5714 ×5 =17.857.

3.5714 × 0.60195:

3.5714 ×0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 ×0.00195=?

3.5714 *0.001 is 0.0035714; 3.5714 *0.00095 is approximately 3.5714 ×0.001=0.0035714; so, 0.95 of 0.001 is 0.00095, so 3.5714 ×0.00095:

3.5714 * 0.00095 = approximately 0.00340 (exact: 3.5714 *0.00095.

But wait: 0.00195 = 0.002 * 0.975.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.00195 as 0.002 – 0.00005. So 3.5714 *0.002=0.0071428, subtract 3.5714 *0.00005=0.00017857.

So 0.0071428-0.00017857=0.00696423.

So 3.5714 ×0.00195 ≈0.00696423.

Thus, 3.5714 ×0.60195 =2.14284 +0.00696423 =2.14980 GeV.

So total is 17.857 +2.14980 =20.0068 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0068 GeV. Which is approximately 20.0068 GeV, not matching any of the options except... the option C is 20.132, which is higher, D is 21.419.

Wait, that can't bet. Or did I miscalculate gamma perhaps?

Wait, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1-v²/c²)), let me recheck the computation.

v=0.96c; v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857..., which is approx 3.5714.

Wait maybe I made an error in the rest mass. Instead of Li-6, perhaps I should have considered the actual nucleus; wait, but the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has 3 neutrons. So Li normally is Li-7 perhaps? Because Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, wait, the problem says 3 neutrons, so mass number would be 3 +3 protons. So actually, that's 3 neutrons and 3 protons, making Li-6.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the selection of the mass.

Do I happen to have the precise atomic mass of Li-6?

Alternatively, perhaps Li-7 is the correct isotope.

Wait the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait Lithium-6. Because natural lithium is mostly Li-7, but the problem refers to Li with 3 neutrons, so which would be Li-6.

But let me double-check—number of protons in lithium is 3. So if X is Li with 3 neutrons, that makes 3+3=6 nucleons, so it's Li-6.

So, perhaps that's correct.

But could the problem have asked per nucleon? Hmm, no, the nucleus would be Li-6, mass 6.

Now, let's think: perhaps I forgot to account for the binding energy properly. Because in the atomic mass, the binding energy is already accounted for.

Wait, so the worst mistake is perhaps the calculation of the mass.

Wait, I should also remember that the binding energy is included in the atomic mass; meaning that the mass of the nucleus (Li-6) is the sum of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons (but electrons are accounted for in ion? Wait.)

Wait, no, for a nucleus, the problem is when considering the bare nucleus. So, for the energy of the nucleus before and after the collision, how is it treated?

Wait, no, in particle physics, for a nucleus, the rest mass is based on the atomic mass, which already includes the electrons (except for bare nuclei).

Wait, but in the context of collider energy, when a nucleus is accelerated, perhaps we think of it as the bare nucleus. So perhaps the mass is just the sum of the protons and neutrons?

Wait, but that's not the case. Atomic masses already factor in the binding energy. So perhaps for a bare nucleus, the mass is approximately that.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, I shouldn't complicate and take the given approach.

Hmm,  I think perhaps I made an error in gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

So Brel=β = v/c =0.96.

γ =1/√(1 - β²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 ≈3.57142857 as before.

So that part's correct.

But maybe converting the mass is the issue.

Alternative approach: perhaps using the more exact value of 1 u.

The exact value of 1 u is 1,822,471,29×10^(-27) kg. But perhaps more useful is using the exact value that 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². So 0.931494 GeV/u.

So: 6.0139 u ×0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Compute 6 ×0.931494=5.588964 GeV.

0.0139 ×0.931494 = 0.0139 ×0.931= approx 0.012934 (compute it exactly: 0.0139 ×0.931494).

0.931494 ×0.0139:

Compute step-by-step,

Compute 0.931494 × 0.01 =0.00931494

Plus 0.931494 ×0.0039 = ?. Let me compute 0.931494 ×0.0039.

0.931494 *0.003 =0.002794482

Plus 0.931494 *0.0009=0.0008383446

Total is  0.002794482 + 0.0008383446 =0.0036328266.

So 0.00931494 +0.0036328266=0.012947766 GeV.

So total E_rest = 5.588964 +0.012947766 =5.601912 GeV.

Hmm, same approximate as before.

Thus, 5.601912 GeV ×3.5714286≈?

So math time: 5.601912 ×3.5714286.

Wait, perhaps it would be helpful to compute this as:

Let me compute 3.5714286 ×5.601912.

3.5714286 = 25/7 (since 25/7 ≈3.57142857). So, 25/7 *5.601912.

Wait yes! Because 3.5714286 is approximately 25/7.

So,

5.601912 * (25/7) =

Compute 5.601912 *25= 140.0478.

Then divide by 7: 140.0478 /7 ≈20.00682857 GeV.

Wow, ok, so 20.006828 GeV.

Looking back at the options, none of the options have this value. The closest are option C at 20.132 GeV and option B is 23.069, but 20 is closer to option C.

Hmm. One of the steps I did earlier got me 20.132 GeV, but I'm confusing. Did I miscalculate gamma?

Wait, perhaps the speed isn't 0.96c in the lab's frame? Maybe I have to consider rest energies differently? Or wait, perhaps the question states energy of RHIC is the energy each beam? I'm a bit rusty on RHIC’s setup.

Wait, examining RHIC: It’s a collider, so it has two beams moving in opposite directions. RHIC collides ions in a storage ring.

But perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, the overall energy per ion would be gamma * m0 c². But wait, in colliders, each beam's particles are accelerated to energy E, but considering they're moving toward each other, their energies add up in the CM (center of mass) frame. But the question is about the energy each beam has, right?

Wait the problem says, what is the energy of RHIC... so each nucleus is accelerated to ... energy. So perhaps that's just the kinetic energy, or the total energy?

No, the total energy, which we calculated as gamma m c².

But none of the options match 20 GeV.

Hold on, looking at the calculation, I got about 20.0068 GeV. Close but no option close to 20 GeV, except option C:20.132 GeV. How can I reach that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma, maybe using more precise numbers. Let me recompute gamma.

Wait, going back: beta is 0.96; beta squared is 0.96^2 =0.9216.

So, 1 - beta^2 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28; correct. So 1/sqrt(...) = 3.5714 exactly.

Another approach perhaps: to use a calculator and perform precise calculations.

Wait, what is 3.5714 ×5.601912 GeV.

Let me compute this using exact decimals.

3.57142857 =25/7 ≈3.5714285714

25/7 multiplied by 5.601912:

We can compute 5.601912 *25 = 140.0478.

Divided by 7:

140.0478 /7 =20.00682857 GeV.

Hmm, again 20.0068... GeV.

But the option isn't present. Hmm.

Alternative thought: perhaps in the problem, we need more precise figures. I omitted going into more precise steps with mass and gamma.

AH! Alternatively, perhaps the error was in the computation of m0, so let me find a more precise molar mass of Li-6.

Looking up the atomic mass of Li-6, authentic sources say it's approximately 6.01390 u. So correct.

But perhaps the exact way it's counted in particle nuclei: include binding energy. Or perhaps it's the mass of the bare nucleus.

Wait another point: when a nucleus is moving, its energy is relativistic.

But in any case, perhaps the calculation needs to give more precise gamma.

Wait, computing gamma as 25/7. Wait, 25/7 is an approximation.

Ah wait, let me recalculate γ. Instead of taking it's 1/0.28, perhaps compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) more precisely.

Wait, 1 - (0.96)^2 is 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= let me compute it more accurately.

Well, 0.28^2=0.0784, right. So it's precise, no problem.

Hrm, another angle: perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product of gamma and rest mass.

Wait, another approach, let's compute 3.5714 *5.601912.

So 3 *5.601912=16.805736

0.5 *5.601912=2.800956

0.0714 *5.601912: let me compute that.

Compute 5.601912 *0.0714.

5.601912 × 0.07 =0.39213384

5.601912 × 0.0014=0.0078426768

Total: 0.39213384 + 0.0078426768 ≈0.3999765168

So sum all components: 16.805736 +2.800956 =19.606692. Then plus 0.3999765≈19.606692 +0.3999765=20.0066685.

Exactly, some computational errors but so close to approximately 20.0066685 GeV.

Hm, but the options given are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419.

Wait, but perhaps the question is incorporating the binding energy in a different way; perhaps the calculation needs to consider the mass as number of nucleons times average mass of a nucleon, taking binding energy into account.

Wait, wait, perhaps another approach would be to compute the energy using rest mass per nucleon with better approximation.

Maybe more precisely, the energy is more like (number of nucleons) × m_p × gamma.

Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², neutron about 941 MeV/c².

But perhaps for the purpose of a rough calculation, average around 938.5 MeV per nucleon.

So 6 ×938.5=5631 MeV, so 5.631 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714.

E=5.631 ×3.5714 ≈ around 20.04 GeV.

Still, no option given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about total kinetic energy only, but total energy includes rest. Including only kinetic energy would give E_kinetic = (gamma-1) m0 c².

In the options that could make sense; perhaps. Let's compute.

E_k= (gamma-1) *5.631 (GeV). 

Gamma is 3.5714, gamma-1=2.5714; then 2.5714 ×5.631 is?

2.5 ×5.631=14.0775. 0.0714 ×5.631 ≈0.403. So together 14.48 GeV. Still not any of the options.

Hmm. Perhaps, the issue is that in the problem they're thinking per nucleon basis? Or perhaps mistake in considering the nuclei as Li-7 instead of Li-6.

Wait. Another check: compute what gamma for a 20 GeV per Li-6 would give in velocity.

Wait, so if E =20 GeV,

m0 c²=5.6019 GeV. So gamma = E/(m0 c^2) =20 /5.6019 ≈3.57.

We calculated that velocity, which is 0.96c. So this would be approx 20 GeV.

Hmm.

But the answer choices don't have exactly that. So perhaps I messed up m0. Let me double-back to molar masses.

Wait, another possible error source: protons and neutrons have different masses, adding their exact rest masses maybe I should use each proton as 938.272 MeV, neutron 941.432 MeV.

Wait, let's compute the actual rest mass of Li-6 as 3 protons +3 neutrons.

3*(938.272) +3*(941.432) MeV =3*(1899.704) MeV? Wait,

Wait: each proton is about 938.272 MeV, each neutron 941.432 MeV.

So, for 3 protons:

3 * 938.272 =2,814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *941.432 =2,824.296 MeV.

Total:2,814.816 +2,824.296=5,639.112 MeV ≈5.639112 GeV.

So m0 c² =5.639112 GeV.

Ah! That's a bit different from earlier 5.60...What a Difference!

Ah, yeah, because when using the precise mass of each nucleon, sum of protons and neutrons is about 5.639 GeV, which is higher than the atomic mass (6.0139 u is about 5.602 GeV).

Wait, this is because the atomic mass already includes binding energy. Binding energy is mass defect, which would lead to a lower mass for the nucleus as compared to sum of individual nucleons.

Wait no: according to Einstein, binding energy (which comes from mass defect) is the energy released, so the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons.

Ah, wait, so the mass of a nucleus is (sum of individual masses) – (mass loss due to binding energy).

Which would mean that if (number of protons * mass of proton + neutrons * neutron mass) is, Li-6 would have that sum minus the binding energy, leading to a lower mass.

But according to what I computed earlier using the u conversion, 1u converted to GeV gives me m0 c² of 5.602 GeV. But if I take into account that the mass of the nucleus is 3(938.272) +3(941.432) minus the binding energy, that would give a slightly lower E.

Wait, but in reality, this would perhaps calculate as:

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0139 u (calculated as 5.602 GeV) → of this, the rest mass is 5.602 GeV.

But when considering the sum of individual nucleons, it's higher because you're not accounting for binding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the exact rest mass of the nucleus.

But this contradicts the earlier method. Now I'm a bit confused.

In any case, perhaps given the discrepancy between 20 GeV from initial calculations and no available option, maybe I made a miscalculation in the sum of exatrest masses.

Let me recap: with the z of 3 protons and n of 3: 6 nucleons, each approximately around 938 MeV. So total (roughly) 6 * 938 = 5,628 MeV, 5.628 GeV. Gamma is 3.5714, so E =5.628 *3.5714.

5.628 ×3 is 16.884, 5.628 ×0.5714≈5.628 ×0.5= 2.814, 5.628 ×0.0714≈0.403, so adding gives 2.814 +0.403≈3.217, add to 16.884 to get≈20.101 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.101 GeV.

Looking at options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but perhaps the precise calculation involves more digits.

Another approach: calculate 3.57142857 *5.639112 GeV.

Which is:

3.57142857 *5.639112.

3 *5.639112 =16.917336

0.57142857 *5.639112.

Calculate 0.5*5.639112=2.819556.

0.07142857 *5.639112≈0.07142857 ×5 =0.35714285 plus 0.07142857×0.639112≈0.0458571.

So ≈0.35714285 +0.0458571≈0.4030.

So total for 0.57142857 is 2.819556 +0.4030 ≈3.222556.

Total overall:16.917336 +3.222556≈20.14 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.14 GeV, matching one of the options. Looking again, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is higher at 21.419.

Wait, perhaps just a bit more accurate on this.

Wait another approach: compute 3.57142857 ×5.639112.

Multiply each term:

5.639112 *3 =16.917336

5.639112 *0.57142857.

5.639112 ×0.5 =2.819556.

5.639112 ×0.07 = 0.39473784.

5.639112 ×0.00142857≈ ≈0.00805664 (since 5.639112 × 0.001= 0.005639112; 0.00042857×5.639112≈0.00242≈over is 0.005639112+.00242=0.00805911.

Adding together: 2.819556 +0.39473784=3.21429384, plus 0.00805664=3.22235048.

Adding to 16.917336:16.917336 +3.22235048=20.13968648 GeV.

Hmm, which is approximately 20.1397 GeV, which is about 20.1397 GeV. So roughly 20.1397 GeV, considering everything.

Looking at the options, the nearest is C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, 20.1397 is about 20.14 GeV, so perhaps I still have an miscalculation.

To be precise, let me compute the gamma and E again.

Wait, gamma =1/(sqrt(1-beta^2)).

Beta is 0.96 → beta squared is 0.9216.

1−beta squared=0.0784; sqrt} is 0.28 → gamma=1/0.28=3.5714286.

Ok, so using this value and no other.

3.5714286 ×5.639112 GeV.

We can multiply more precisely:

Let me compute 5.639112 ×3.5714286.

Break it down:

5 ×3.5714286= 17.857143.

0.639112 ×3.5714286.

Compute, 0.6 ×3.5714286=2.14285716.

0.039112 ×3.5714286.

Multiply 0.03 ×3.5714286=0.10714286.

0.009112 ×3.5714286 → approx 0.03256.

So total from 0.039112 is approximately 0.10714286 +0.03256=0.1397.

So, 2.14285716 + 0.1397 ≈2.282557.

Summing all parts:

17.857143 (from 5× gamma) + 2.282557 (from the other 0.639112 ×gamma) = total 20.1397 GeV.

That brings E to 20.1397 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) and round you could say approximately 20.14 GeV. So the discrepancy is 0.0077 GeV which is ≈7.7 MeV, which seems a small difference—I have… forget, perhaps, incorrect molar mass earlier.

Wait, yet, the actual calculation using the correct atomic mass of Li-6 (6.0139 u) comes to 5.602 GeV, while the sum of precise nucleon masses comes to approximately 5.639 GeV.

Which leads to the conclusion that 5.639 GeV is a better approximation because the sum of individual nucleon masses is higher due to binding energy? Which would suggest that using 5.639 GeV as m0 c^2 is too high. 

Hmm—wait a minute: the binding energy causes a reduction in mass, right. So sum of component protons and neutrons would be higher, while the actual nucleus mass is less.

Previously, we used the atomic mass of the nucleus, which accounts for binding energy as a mass deficit. So if N=Li-6, the rest mass is 6.0139u → 5.602 GeV.

So perhaps our initial approach was correct, ignoring踉跄高 Nussinov approach using individual nucleon masses.

So in this case, rest mass of approx 5.6019 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c^2.

E≈3.5714 ×5.6019 [GeV] = ?

Let me compute 3 ×5.6019 =16.8057.

0.5714 ×5.6019 =?

First, 0.5 ×5.6019 =2.80095.

0.0714 ×5.6019   =0.4030 (approx).

Adding =2.80095 +0.4030=3.20395.

Total E =16.8057 +3.20395≈  20.00965 GeV, so approx 20.0097 GeV.

But wait another way: if 3.5714 ×5.601912 ≈20.0068 GeV.

Hmm.

So unless I made a miscalculation, the problem
