Question: What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?

Knowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.

PS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.
A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419

Assistant Response:
To find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) is 0.96c, we need to use the relativistic energy formula. The formula for the total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[ E = \gamma m_{X} c^2 \]

where:
- \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, given by \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\),
- \(m_{X}\) is the rest mass of the nucleus X,
- \(v\) is the velocity of the particle,
- \(c\) is the speed of light.

For a lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons (Li-7), the rest mass can be approximated by adding the rest masses of a lithium nucleus (which typically has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but for simplicity, we use Li-7 here):

\[ m_{X} \approx 7 \times m_p \]
\[ m_{X} \approx 7 \times 1.6726219 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \]
\[ m_{X} \approx 1.1708353 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \]

Given \(v = 0.96c\), we can calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\):

\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.96c}{c}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} \approx 3.3166 \]

Now, the total relativistic energy is:

\[ E = \gamma m_{X} c^2 \]
\[ E \approx 3.3166 \times 1.1708353 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]
\[ E \approx 3.3166 \times 1.1708353 \times 10^{-26} \times 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{J} \]
\[ E \approx 3.614 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J} \times 6.2415 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV/J} \]  (1 GeV = \(1.602176634 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J}\))

\[ E \approx 23.069 \, \text{GeV} \]
