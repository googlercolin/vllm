Question: Two stars (Star_1 and Star_2) each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun, respectively. Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

A) ~3.9
B) ~12.6
C) ~0.8
D) ~1.2

Assistant Response:
To solve the problem, we first need to understand the given information and how it can be used to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

The abundance ratios given are in units of dex (decibels in astronomy). The formula provided is:
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{element}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right) = \text{[element/H]} + 12 \]
Where \([ \text{element/H} ]\) is the abundance ratio of the element to hydrogen.

For the Sun, we know:
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right) = 7.5 \]
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right) = 7 \]

For Star_1, we know:
\[ [ \text{Si/Fe} ] = 0.3 \text{ dex} \]
This means:
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\right) = 0.3 \]
For Star_2, we need \([ \text{Si/H} ]\) to find the ratio \(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\).

Using the same logic for Star_1, the ratio \(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\) in Star_1's photosphere can be expressed as:
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\right) = 7.5 + 0.3 = 7.8 \]
\(\log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\right) = 0.8\)
\(\Rightarrow \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\) = \(10^{0.8}\) ≈ 6.31

We need the \([ \text{Si/H} ]\) for Star_1:
\[ 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right) = 12 + \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\right) - \log_{10} \left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right) \]
\[ = 7.5 + 0.8 - (7.5 - 7) \]
\[ = 7.5 + 0.8 - 0.5 \]
\[ = 7.8 \]

Then the ratio of silicon atoms in the photosphere of Star_1 to the Sun’s photosphere is:
\[ \frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} (\text{Star_1})}{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} (\text{Sun})} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.31 \]

Star_2 does not have a given [Si/H] value, but the ratio \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 \text{ dex}\) implies relative proportions but no [Si/H] specific value. We then use the Sun’s abundance and the given [Si/Fe] ratio to directly calculate the effect on silicon:
\[ \frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} (\text{Star_2})}{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} (\text{Sun})} \approx 6.31 \times \text{(effect based on relative Mg/Si)} \]

Assuming the relation [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex implies a stable relationship in terms of [Si/H] the effect would still keep the silicon abundance proportional to iron.

Given the choices, the closest match to the calculated ratio is:
A) ~3.9

Answer: A
