Question: In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwellâ€™s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?
A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. 
B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  
C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. 
D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.

Assistant Response:
In a universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, the fundamental property that changes is the ability to have a non-zero magnetic charge (magnetic monopole). This directly affects Maxwell's equations. Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero, would no longer hold true. Therefore, the equation related to the divergence of the magnetic field would need to be altered.

Answer: A
