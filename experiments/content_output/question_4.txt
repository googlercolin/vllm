<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question says that in a parallel universe, a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. Wait, in our universe, magnets are dipoles, right? So they have both north and south poles that are connected, unable to be isolated. But here, they can have isolated poles, like monopoles.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. I think they are:

1. The divergence of E is rho/epsilon0: relates to electric charge.
2. Div of B is zero (in our world because there are no magnetic monopoles).
3. Curl of E is -dB/dt: Faraday's Law.
4. Curl of B is mu0 times the current plus displacement current: Ampere's Law.

So, in our world, because there are no magnetic monopoles, div B is zero. But the question states that in this parallel universe, they do have magnetic monopoles. So div B would no longer be zero—it would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) divided by some constant?

So Maxwell's equations as we know them would change. Which equations? Let's see.

Maxwell's equations have four, and depending on which terms are involved, it affects different equations. The question is, which equation(s) are different.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of B. In our universe, div B=0, but in this one, div B = something else. So equation 2 would change. So if the question depends on which equation is changed, A says only equation 2 is different.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of E and div of B. That would imply two equations change—equation 3 (curl E) and equation 2 (div B). But wait, no. From the options, Option B seems to say both equations related to two specific aspects change. For B being correct, two Maxwell equations (div B and curl E) would be different. But wait, in the case of monopoles, does Faraday's Law (curl E = - dB/dt) remain the same?

Let me think: Right now, the presence of a magnetic monopole would mean that, perhaps, Faraday's law would have an additional term. Wait, no—in our world, if you have changing B fields, you get circulating E fields. If B has monopoles, does that affect Faraday's law? Or just the divergence.

Wait, maybe the presence of a magnetic charge doesn't change the curl of E... Because in static cases, if B is divergence-free (which it's not, if we have monopoles), in the static situation, div B is rho_m. But during time varying fields, does that affect Faraday's law?

Wait, no—if we include magnetic charge/density, Faraday's Law should stay more or less the same because it's about the time change of B. But Maxwell equation would be modified as follows: Oh wait, actually, wait—if there's a current towards B (magnetic current), does that affect other terms?

Wait, actually, I need to recall how Maxwell's equations change when magnetic monopoles are present.

In the presence of magnetic charges, the curl of E would remain the same (curl E = - dB/dt), and the divergence of B would now be proportional to the magnetic charge density (div B = rho_m / some constant, say, mu0).

Wait, wait, another possibility—I think that with magnetic monopoles, both Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law are affected. Let me think:

Wait, in the standard scenario without monopoles, the four are:

1. div E = rho/ep0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu0 (J + eps0 dE/dt)

But if magnetic monopoles exist, div B is non-zero.

Additionally, what about Ampère's Law—the curl of B. With monopoles, there's a displacement current for B as well? Or wait, when you have magnetic charges, you might add terms into Faraday's law and into Ampère's law.

Actually, I remember that when magnetic monopoles exist, the Maxwell's Equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / eps0  (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / mu0
3. curl E = - (1/eps0) * dM/dt, where M is the magnetic current. Or wait, perhaps with both electric and magnetic charges, each equation gets modified. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the curl equations for E and B include terms for both electric and magnetic currents.

Alternatively, another version: when there are magnetic charges, you have the following:

Maxwell’s equations with both electric and magnetic charges are:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε0  
∇ · B = ρ_m / μ0  
∇ × E = - (1/ε0) ∂ρ_m/∂t  - J_m / ε0  
∇ × B = μ0 J_e + μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t  

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I've read that when magnetic charges exist, two of Maxwell's equations will acquire sources: ∇·B becomes non-zero, and ∇×E will have an additional term related to the current density of magnetic charge.

So, in other words:

div E : same as before, unless perhaps considering magnetic charge alongside, but no. No, electric and magnetic charge densities are separate.

Alternatively, if the only thing is that magnetic monopoles exist, then the modified equations are:

div B = rho_m / mu0, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. 

And Faraday's Law (curl E) might acquire a term related to the magnetic current density, J_m. Because in the original, it's curl E = -dB/dt, from the original no magnetic sources. But if there's a current, maybe.

Wait, perhaps it's:

In the presence of magnetic currents, the curl E equation would include a term associated with the magnetic current. Because for moving magnetic charges.

Wait, in this case, maybe two equations change. The ∇·B equation (since it now has a charge), and in the ∇×E (since moving magnetic charges would contribute current-like terms).

Another point is, Maxwell's equations are symmetric when considering monopoles. Without monopoles, divergence of E is (rho_e term), divergence of B is zero. If you add monopoles, you get div B in terms of rho_m.

Similarly, if you have electric current and displacement in Ampère's law, perhaps with monopoles, the Faraday's law would need to include terms about the magnetic current.

Wait, here’s another approach. In the normal equations, only E has a divergence (first equation), and the others are about fields. With monopoles, also B's divergence is non-zero—so equation two changes.

Also, because in equation 3 (curl E), you have dB/dt perhaps changing due to magnetic currents. Similarly, Ampère's law (equation 4) could be modified, but it includes B's curl—divided by perhaps a current term.

But let me step back and think about Maxwell's equations. The four are:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε0    [source: electric charge]
2. ∇ · B = 0            [source: magnetic charge]
3. ∇ × E = − ∂B/∂t     [source: magnetic current]
4. ∇ × B = μ0 (J_e + ε0 ∂E/∂t)  [source: electric current and displacement]

If magnetic monopoles exist, two of these equations will get an extra term. Which two?

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong:

In equation 2, since you have magnetic monopoles, div B would no longer be zero. It would be (rho_m)/mu0, where mu0 is the permeability of free space.

In equation 3, if there's a magnetic current (J_m), then the equation becomes:

∇ × E = - (∂B/∂t) - (J_m)/epsilon0  [or some variation, depending on the units]

Wait, wait. Let's try to see symmetries. Maxwell's equations are supposed to be symmetric between E and B when both electric and magnetic charges are present. So version of Maxwell's equations being symmetric is:

∇ · E = rho_e / ε0  
∇ · B = rho_m / μ0  
∇ × E = − (mu0 J_m + ∂B/∂t)  
∇ × B = ε0 J_e + ε0 μ0 ∂E/∂t  

Wait wait, that doesn’t seem right. Another approach: When magnetic monopoles exist, the equations change in two ways.

Alternative take: if only magnetic monopoles exist, then do Ampère's law and Faraday's law change? In our standard setup without monopoles, the curl of E is determined by the time derivative of B. If there's a current, perhaps either electric or magnetic, the curl would have an additional term.

Wait, putting it all together, initially the two equations affected by the presence of monopoles would be:

- The one with div B (equation 2) changes from zero to something.
- And, does any other equation change? For instance, perhaps the curl of E or curl of B would pick up a current term.

Wait, the Ampère's law (equation 4) involves the currents. But Ampère's circuital law in our world has the electric current plus the displacement current. If magnetic currents exist, would they affect Ampère's law? Maybe. Perhaps, when considering moving magnetic charges (magnetic current, like J_m), that would add a term to the equation in the same way J_e adds.

Wait, but how does that tie into Maxwell's equations? Let me try to recall.

Without magnetism as dipoles, the Maxwell equations undergo symmetric changes. So the four equations in their modified form would be:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0 
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / μ0 
3. ∇ × E = −(∂B/∂t) − (J_m)/(ε0)
4. ∇ × B = μ0 J_e + μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t 

So equation 1's content doesn't change except for equation 2, 3, 4. Wait wait, no. Equation 4 in our world doesn't have any reference to J_m, the magnetic current. So if J_m is present (like in this scenario), do they only affect equation 2 and 3?

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 also changes. Wait, let me see.

The symmetry is that with monopoles, both electric and magnetic contributions are present. Without monopoles, equation 2 is zero, equation 3 and 4 have terms from the other.

Wait, perhaps the actual modified equations are:

- Equation 2: div B = mu0 rho_m 
- Equation 3: curl E = -(dB/dt) + other terms? Hmm.

Wait a second, in reality, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the governing equations would include sources for both fields, so that:

The divergence of each field is determined by the corresponding source (electric or magnetic). Additionally, in the curl equations, each would have a source from the time derivative of the other field (as well as any current terms).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of each equation. The divergence and curl equations for each field.

In our universe:
- div E = rho_e/(eps0)
- div B = 0
- curl E = -dB/dt
- curl B = mu0 J_e + mu0 eps0 dE/dt

If we have magnetic monopoles:
- div B = rho_m/(mu0)
- curl E gets an additional term for magnetic current.

Wait, another point: Since in current Maxwell's equations, Faraday's law includes -dB/dt, but when you have magnetic charges, E can have a curl due to moving magnetic charges. 

Wait, thinking in terms of symmetry: The equations become symmetric with two sources for each.

So, the curl of E would be related not just to dB/dt, but also to J_m (magnetic current). Similarly, the curl of B would be related to J_e and dE/dt.

Wait, wait. Suppose:

∇×E = - ε0 μ0 (∂B/∂t) - J_m 

Hmm, perhaps the units would line up. Or maybe it's scaled by other constants.

Alternatively, maybe the curl of E becomes something with both the time derivative and the current.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, you also get terms for the magnetic current in Faraday's Law.

Wait, Paul S. Wesson has a nice summary. When magnetic monopoles exist, the modified Maxwell equations are:

∇ · E = ρ_e/(ε0)       (unchanged)
∇ · B = ρ_m/(μ0)       (now non-zero)
∇ × E = - (∂ B/∂ t) - J_m/(ε0) (added magnetic current term)
∇ × B = μ0 ε0 (∂ E/∂ t) + μ0 J_e

Wait, but in our original Maxwell equations, equation 4 is ∇ × B = μ0 (J_e + ε0 ∂ E/∂ t ). If magnetic monopoles presence don't change equation 4, it would then only affect equations 3 and 2.

But how?

Wait... I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me simplify the question.

The question is, if a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole (so, magnetic monopoles exist), which Maxwell equations are different.

In reality, in the standard model, we don't have monopoles, so equations 1 and 2 are about E and B's divergence sources respectively. So when we add monopoles, equation 2's divergence of B changes, but what about equation 3 (curl E)?

In our universe, equation 3: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t, no other terms because there are no magnetic currents.

If monopoles exist, suppose that moving magnetic charges (magnetic current Jm) would influence E. Then, equation 3 would have a term involving Jm. So equation3 would change.

Wait, but alternately, equation3 is modified to include the magnetic current.

So, first the divergence of B (equation2) is no longer zero; so the equation changes. Also, equation3 is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - (Jm / (epsilon0)) or something like that, leading equation3 to also change.

Which means that, in this scenario, two Maxwell equations change: equation 2 and equation3. So looking back at the options.

The options are:

A) Only divergence of B.

B) The ones related to the circulation (curl) of E and divergence of B.

So equation 3 and equation 2 are modified. So the choice would then point to option B, because it says "the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field." That is, equations3 and 2 change.

Wait, so looking at the options again:

Option A) Only the divergence of B.

Option B) Circulation of E and divergence of B: so two.

Option C) Circulation of B and E flux? Not exactly. E flux in terms of...(probably incorrect)

Option D) Divergence and curl of B? So equation2 and equation4 (as equation4 relates to curl B). Hmm.

Maxwell’s equations: equation two is div B, equation three is curl E, equation four is curl B.

Wait, if only 2 and 3 change, option B says equations related to the circulation of E (equation3 change) and divergence of B (equation2). So option B says 'the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.' So equation3 and 2.

Let me think again: if equation2 now has magnetic charge, it's modified. Equation3 incorporates terms from moving monopoles (Jm), so it is modified. So which options discuss both parts?

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ones related to ... the circulation of electric field (equation3) and divergence of B (equation2). So two of Maxwell's equations change.

Which options are available in the choices? The options for B and D would be among them.

Wait the question is saying which equations are different. So in this scenario, two Maxwell's equations would change—div B and curl E. So the correct answer is option B or D?

The options: option B states which two are which equation?

Option B: ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation3) and divergence of B (equation2).

Option D: the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field: equation2 (div B) and equation4 (curl B)—so this would suggest that equation4 (curl B) has changes as well.

Wait, why would equation4 change? If we only have isolated monopoles, perhaps [equation4, the one relating curl of B to current and displacement] doesn’t change.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, does Ampère's law change? Ampère's law, equation4, relates the curl of B to the electric current plus displacement current. If Jm exists (magnetic current), would it appear in Ampère's law, or Faraday's?

Wait, in the symmetric version, both E and B have sources, so four sources:

- E has electric charge (equation1),
- B has magnetic charge (equation2),
- E's curl is affected by time derivative of B and magnetic current (equation3),
- B's curl is affected by electric current and time derivative of E (equation4 remains the same?).

Wait, but without magnetic monopoles, the equation for curl E is in terms of dB/dt only. If monopoles with Jm exist, perhaps equation3 includes -dB/dt minus Jm.

In that case, equation3 changes and equation2 changes.

Thus Option B is the correct answer, as per the question.

Which option says, 'the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field'? Option B. The others: option D seems to refer to the curl of B equation and the divergence.

So the answer should be options where both the divergence of B and the circulation of E change. So Maxwell's equations are affected in two places, equations 2 and 3. Therefore, the optimal choice is option B.
</think>

In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations undergo specific modifications compared to our universe. In our universe, magnetic monopoles are absent, leading to the condition **∇ · B = 0**. The presence of isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) changes this, causing the divergence of the magnetic field to become **∇ · B = ρ_m / μ_0**, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. This modifies the second Maxwell equation.

Additionally, the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces magnetic current density, denoted as **J_m**. This affects the third Maxwell equation, Faraday's Law, which in our universe is **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t**. With magnetic currents, the equation is modified to include a term for the magnetic current density, becoming **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / ε_0**. Thus, the third Maxwell equation also changes.

The other equations remain unaffected in this scenario:
1. **∇ · E = ρ_e / ε_0** (Gauss's Law for electricity) remains unchanged.
2. **∇ × B = μ_0 (J_e + ε_0 ∂E/∂t)** (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction) is not modified because it deals with electric currents and displacement, which are unrelated to magnetic monopoles.

In summary, the presence of magnetic monopoles modifies two Maxwell equations: **∇ · B** (divergence of the magnetic field) and **∇ × E** (curl of the electric field). These correspond to the second and third equations, respectively.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States only the divergence of the magnetic field is modified. This is incorrect because the curl of the electric field is also affected.
- **Option B**: States the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. This is correct, as both the second and third Maxwell equations are modified.
- **Option C**: Refers to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field, which are not relevant here.
- **Option D**: Refers to the divergence and curl of the magnetic field. While the divergence of the magnetic field changes, the curl of the magnetic field (Ampère's Law) remains unaffected.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the two Maxwell equations that are modified in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B
