Question: toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.

1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.

2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.

what is the molecular symmetry group of 3?
A) cs
B) d2h
C) c2h
D) c3

Assistant Response:
To determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3, we need to trace the transformations and identify the structure of the final product.

1. **Initial Product (1)**: When toluene (C6H5CH3) is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, it forms nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2).
2. **Product (2)**: Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) is then treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)2COOH).
3. **Product (3)**: 2,4-Dinitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)2COOH) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming 4-nitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)COOH).

The structure of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (C6H3(NO2)COOH) can be visualized as a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached and a nitro group (-NO2) attached to the para position of the benzene ring.

The molecular symmetry group for this structure is **Cs** (reflective symmetry through a plane perpendicular to the C6H3 plane that passes through the COOH and NO2 groups).

Answer: A
