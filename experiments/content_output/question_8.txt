Question: You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1
B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1
C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3

Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's a bit about gene interactions and how they relate to disease resistance in plants. Let's see, the setup is studying white lupine’s resistance to anthracnose using knockout mutants and their combinations.

So first, the problem states that there are three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They tested the resistance to the fungus and got certain percentages which represent how resistant the mutants are compared to the wild type (WT).

The percentages are:

- g1: 75% of WT resistance.
- g2: 0% (so no resistance).
- g3: 50%.
- g1g3: 10%.
- g2g3: 0%.
- g1g2: 0%.

We know that one of these is a transcription factor upstream of others. So perhaps this transcription factor activates other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would likely have a bigger effect because it's regulating a network or other genes.

Looking at the results, when g2 is knocked out, resistance goes down to 0%—that's really low. So without g2, the plant doesn't resist the disease at all. Now, the transcription factor (let's think G2 could be TF) would cause downstream genes to not be expressed.

g3 mutant shows 50% resistance. G3 being a gene downstream of G2 perhaps? Because without G2, you get nothing, but without G3 alone you get 50%, which is half as much.

Now, what about looking at the double mutants? If we take G1 and G3 double mutant (g1g3), their resistance is 10%—lower than both. Hmm, how?

But let me think in terms of order of regulation because they said that at least one is a TF upstream of others. Suppose G2 is the TF. So it probably acts upstream, maybe activating G1 and G3.

Wait, so wild-type has resistance at 100%, g2 is 0%. That suggests that when G2 is gone, other genes dependent on it are also non-functional; so if G2 is the TF for G1 and G3, then without G2, both G1 and G3 won't be expressed, which would probably result in lower resistance.

Similarly, the double mutant g1g2 is 0%. But wait, without G2, the g1 knockout would be redundant, right? Because G2 is upstream, so if g1 is already knocked out, would adding g2 knockout be different? Not sure. Similarly, g3 and g2—without g2, maybe whatever is happening with g3 can't be expressed.

Now, what about the g1 mutant with 75% resistance. So without G1, they're more susceptible but still retain some resistance. If G2's a TF influencing other genes, perhaps G1 is one of those downstream. So without G2, you can't activate upstream, but without G1, another factor lowers resistance, but still 75%—so maybe there's some redundancy. Or maybe G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, let's think about what each敲out line shows.

The most severe resistance defects are in the individual knockouts of g1 (75%), g2 (0%), g3 (50%).

Let me consider which gene's function is required for resistance.

When g2 is knocked out, resistance is 0. So the plant is highly susceptible. If G2 is a transcription factor needed for activating other genes—like G1 and G3—then without G2, G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed either. So in this scenario, their products wouldn't be available, leading to lower resistance.

But if G2 is the only upstream TF, what happens when you have the other knockouts?

Let me look at the double mutants. For instance, g1g2 is 0% resistance. So even though without G2 already (which itself causes 0% resistance), the double knockout with G1 doesn't change it. Same with g2g3 (0%). So for double knockouts including g2, they're all 0%.

What about g1g3, which is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. But when only G1 is knocked out, it's 75%; only G3 is 75%? No, no, wait: g3's resistance is 0%? No, according to the data: g3 is 50% resistance. Correction: g3's resistance is 50%—so that's half of wild type. So in double knockouts, like g1g3, it's even lower at 10%—so when both G1 and G3 are gone, you get more susceptibility (lower resistance) than either alone.

This could suggest that G1 and G3 function slightly additively. When both are nonfunctional, you get less resistance than when only one is.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should model the possibilities based on whether G’s are independent or additive or redundant.

Another approach: Since g2 is a knockout resulting in 0 resistance, perhaps G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. Let's assume G2 is the TF that turns on G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. That would align with why in double mutants like g2g3, the resistance is same as g2—so 0% because even if g3 is out, G2 is the upstream factor.

So given that data:

In the wild type, G2 is expressed and active. G2 activates G1 and G3. Without G2 (g2), all downstream genes are not expressed.

G1 and G3 are perhaps partially redundant? Or, maybe they are both needed but perhaps in the same pathway.

Wait, the wild-type has 100% resistance. Without G2, it's 0%. Without G1 (g1), you have 75%—so not as bad, but still more susceptible. Without G3 (g3), it's 50% resistance.

So maybe G1 and G3 aren't fully dependent on G2. Alternatively, perhaps without G2, all three aren't active.

But wait, the wild-type has 100%, which suggests that when all are functioning, you get maximum resistance. Without G2, function drops to zero because none of the downstream is working.

In the case of g1, at 75%, maybe G2 is functioning but G1 is missing, which is part of the system. But perhaps if G1 is missing, maybe some backup is in place. Alternatively, maybe without G1, other genes can partially compensate, contributing 75% resistance. Because if G2's role is upstream but perhaps G3 can compensate when G1 is missing.

But then why is G3's resistance lower (50% in g3, compared to g1's 75%)? Hmm—that's confusing. Because if G3 is acting after G1, and vice versa. Or may their functions add differently.

Wait, for front loaders, when the downstream is beyond.

Another angle: looking at the double mutants can give hints about epistasis and redundancy. So let's check the double knockouts.

g1g3 is 10%—worse than g1 (75%), worse than g3 (50%). So knocking both G1 and G3 leads to more severe phenotype, but 10% is worse than either. So maybe each contributes some additive or synergistic contribution. So if each of G1 and G3 contributes a certain amount, then knocking out both would drop the resistance much lower.

But for another case: G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both, so without G2, their contribution is nothing, so that's why the double mutant g2G3 doesn't improve anything—still zero.

Wait, but when you have g1g2: g1 and g2 double. The result is same as g2: 0%. So having g2 knocked out suppresses any possible function of G1.

So G2 must act upstream of G1; without G2, G1 can't function (maybe because G2 is the TF activating G1). Therefore, if in the double knockout g1g2, which is a knockout of G1 and G2, the resistance is same as g2. That implies G2's effects are independent of G1. Or perhaps G2 is upstream, and without G2, G1 is non-functional regardless.

Wait, that could imply that G2 is epistatic to G1—meaning that G2 is in a higher regulatory level, such that G2’s function determines the output regardless of G1 (as in, if G2 is knocked out, everything collapses, so regardless of G1, you can't get the pathway working).

Similarly, for g2g3: same as g2, zero resistance. So in this case, the double knockout of g2 and another (like g3) doesn't do worse than g2. So when G2 is already knocked out, any other knockouts (like G3) won't change the resistance status. So this suggests that neither G1 nor G3 can contribute when G2 is inactive.

Furthermore, if you look at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than losing only G1 or G3. So perhaps in the presence of G2, when both G1 and G3 are lost, the resistance is really low because the contributions from G1 and G3 (each missing) combine to lower the resistance further.

Now, think about whether some gene products are transcriptionally regulated. If G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 might be downstream targets. So their gene expression is dependent on G2.

So G2 activates G1 and G3. If G2 is not present, G1 and G3 are not expressed.

So in the single knockouts:

- g1: leaves G2 and G3 to function—is that possible? No, because knocking out G1 would leave G2 and G3, but if G2 is the TF for G1, but if G1 is knocked out, then perhaps G3 is expressed, yet why would a G1 knockout lead to lower resistance (75% WT)? So, G1 may be partially overlapping with G3 function but not fully. So another possibility is that G1 and G3 are both downstream from G2, but each provides some amount of additive resistance.

So, in G1 knockout: since G2 is present and functional; maybe G2 activates G3, which contributes to 50% resistance. But no, that wouldn't fit. Because in the double g1g3, 10% comes. So perhaps without G1, the loss of G3 is more severe.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of models.

Option one: G2 is the TF regulating G1 and G3. So without G2 (g2 KO), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So plant is super susceptible.

In g1 KO: G1 is gone, but G2 and G3 are active. So G3 on its own can only provide 75% resistance.

Wait, but in actual data, g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild-type. Wait, wait, higher resistance in-control? So 100% is most susceptible. Wait no, resistance of 100% is the level in the control. So higher percentage means more susceptibility? Or not?

Wait, wait the question says: resistance of the mutant compared to control. So 100% is same as control, 75% is 75% of that, meaning lower resistance—that would imply higher susceptibility.

Wait I thought the question says "100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen," so perhaps when you see 100% resistance, all plants are resistant. So 75% is three-quarters as resistant. So lower. So more susceptible.

Wait that makes sense. So 35 plants are similar. So in the g1 mutant, the plant has 75% of the control's resistance, meaning they're more susceptible than wild type.

Similarly, g2 (0%) is completely susceptible.

So G1 contributes to some resistance when present, because without it, the resistance is 75%. G3 contributes because without G3 (g3 KO) they have 50% resistance.

Hmm, so maybe resistance is built upon multiple layers. Let's think of G2 as producing a factor that activates G1 and G3. If G2 is missing, nothing happens and the plant can't resist.

If G1 is present, but active, then perhaps it can help produce some level of resistance. G3 produces some, but not as much.

In the double mutant, like g1g3: if both are missing, even if G2 is present (since they have g2 WT), so their absence leads to additive loss—50% (G3) in g3, 75% in g1, but their combined loss is 10%? Or perhaps their networks get lost.

Wait, perhaps not. Because when you have the double knockout without G2, so G2 knockout would have no expression of G1 and G3. So in the presence of G2, when only G1 is out, then G3 is expressed.

Ok, it's tricky.

Let me think of the outputs:

When G2 is intact:

- G1 knockout (g1): resistance 75%.

Assuming that in G2-positive but G1-knockout, the anthracnose resistance is at the same level as when G3 is active. Hmm.

Wait, so what if G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3?

So without G1 (g1), but G2 present: G3 is active, resisting at G3's level. So in such a case, what's the resistance? If without G3, resistance would be 75%—wait no, in g3, resistance is 50%, so G3 is at work. So without G3, but G2 still active (maybe another approach). Hmm, perhaps no, because without G3 gene (g3) function, but maybe G1 or G2 can help.

Wait, maybe without G3 (g3), what's the situation? 50% resistance.

So to sum:

WT: 100% (G2 activates both G1 and G3→ full resistance)

g2: 0% → no G2, so no activation of G1 or G3; zero resistance.

g1: 75% → G2's active, so G3 is active, gives 75%? Or wait, maybe in the absence of G1, G2 still functions, but not? No, G2 is upstream. So G1 and G3 are both downstream, and if G2 is present, then both are active. But if G1 is knocked out, then only G3 is active. So what's the resistance when only G3 is active?

Wait another way, maybe the resistance is a sum of the contributions of G1 and G3.

If in WT:

G1 contributes resistance R1, G3 contributes R2.

Combined, resistance is R1 + R2 = 100%.

In g1, G3 is active: R3 which is R2 = 50% (as in the data g3 is 50%). But in the real data, g1 is 75% in resistance, higher than G3's 50%. So that model doesn't fit.

So alternative: perhaps G2's presence is needed to activate a gene responsible for resistance. So when you have G2, it's required to have either G1 or G3 (or both) to induce resistance.

In that case:

g1: without G1, but you have G2, so G3 has to be the one providing, which would be something. But g3 without G3, G2 can't activate it, leading to 50%– I'm confused.

Wait the data is:

Looking at the single mutants, their resistances are:

g1: 75%

g2:0%

g3:50%

So the decrease in resistance when G2 is off is the most dramatic, which suggests G2 is a key regulator. Without G2, all downstream processes are gone.

Then, perhaps the interaction is such that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, which are in parallel pathways. When G2 is present, both can be active. Without either G1 or G3, some of the resistance is lost.

Thus:

g1: without G1, G2 activates G3, leading to some resistance, 75%. Perhaps R of g1 is R_WT * (G3 / (G1 + G3))

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach is to find epistatic relationships.

The concept of epistasis can help. Epistasis is when the expression of one gene is dependent on another gene. An epistatic gene is one that affects the pathway downstream. For example, if gene A produces a product that is upstream of gene B’s product, then gene A is epistatic to gene B. Because when A is non-functional, it doesn’t matter what B does. (Like, in a pathway A → B → ...)

Looking at the data, if you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, resistance is worse than either. So each contributes individually to the resistance.

But in double mutants: 

- g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% resistence. So having g2 in the double with any of the others leads to 0. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because without G2, the effect of G1 or G3 knockout is completely masked.

In terms of genetic hierarchy, if G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, then the phenotype would be such. Because, without G2's function, it doesn't matter what G1 and G3 are doing.

Now, let's look at the effect of double g1g3 at 10%.

If G2 is active, then G1 and G3 can contribute to resistance. If G1 is absent (g1), then G3's function may contribute to 75% resistance. Similarly, without G3 (g3), G1 has correcting perhaps 75% comes from G3? No, not exactly.

Wait, let's model:

When both G1 and G3 are present (WT): 100%

Only G1 present (G3 knocked out): r1

Only G3 present (G1 knocked out): r2

Both G1 and G3 knocked out: r1 + r2? But which would give r1 + r2.

But in the data:

g1 =75%

g3 =50%

g1g3 =10%.

So according to data:

WT: 100% = 1

g1:75% = 0.75 → when G3 is present (since G1 is knocked out, but in actuality, g1 also has other genes).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Time to proceed to the options.

The question is about which conclusion you can draw from the experiment regarding the genes’ interactions.

Options:

A) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic towards G1.

B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, G1 epistatic towards G3.

D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what's the options saying:

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (pleiotropic genes affect multiple traits or pathways), and G1 is epistatic towards G3 (so G1 is upstream). So the phenotype of G3 depends on G1?

Option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy: so G1 and G3 have overlapping functions such that when both are KOed, the effect is worse than either alone.

Looking at the data, for g1g3, 10% which is worse than either. So when both are missing, it’s worse, implying that each contributes something and they are not fully redundant, but perhaps they additively contribute.

Hmm, the summary may be as follows:

G2's the TF, acting upstream of G1 and G3, which may depend on each other. But what does the epistatic relationship look like?

Because in the single knockouts, g1 is 75% as resistant as WT, g3 is 50% as resistant. So perhaps G3 and G1 contribute to resistance. But when both are missing, it's 10%, which is a sum, but not a multiple.

Wait typical additive scenario:

If G1 and G3 are in parallel (such as each can perform the function in part), then knocking both would add their contributions.

But this seems not the case here because either G1 or G3 provides some resistance, but both together add even worse: 10% is much less than either. But 75 +50 equals 125, but in percentage terms: depending on whether the system responds additively or multiplicatively.

It's complicated, but perhaps that's not the way to go. Instead, think about the multiple-choice for the answer.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are in redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3 that implies that G1 is upstream of G3.

But without G3 (g3 singl), resistance is 50% which is higher than G2's 0%, so that would make sense. However, if G1 is epistatic (upstream) of G3, then in double g1g3, maybe allows some residual.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the individual KO’s and epistasis.

If G2 is the upstream TF, activating both G1 and G3.

Think of G1 and G3 as being in the same pathway, perhaps.

In the case where G2 is epistatic to both, because without G2, the functions cannot happen.

In the double-mutant g1g3, what's the conclusion? If G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, like G2 activates both, and then each contribute, then KO of both's genes would eliminate 100% of their contributions. But the data shows g1g3 gives 10% resistance which is worse than either single.

This suggests that both provide additive contributions when both are active, but if both pathways are knocked out, the plant's overall resistance drops even more.

Hmm, another potential interpretation: G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway or gene family.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, losing both would push the phenotype further. So a higher severity for g1g3, which it does: 10% < 50% < 75%.

Thus, in this scenario, G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3. When it's present, both are active, providing 100% resistance. When either G1 or G3 is absent, redundancy is present, but the other can provide partial resistance—so in losing G1, you get 75% (do G3 compensates 75%), and losing G3 gives 50%. So this suggests that G3's elimination is worse than G1's. Perhaps because G1 and G3 are both being activated by G2, but G3 contributes more resistance gene expression.

Redundancy suggests that their functions can overlap, so knocking one would not eliminate the other's function—but once both are gone, resistance is minimized beyond single KOs.

In that case, the conclusion would be that G2 is TF activated, G1 and G3 are redundant, and as per their epistatic relationships.

How redundancy could formalize here: if G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So without G1, G3 can still function but to a lesser extent, and vice versa. So double knockout would be worse.

So moving back to the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D states that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So to clarify, "epistatic towards G3"—if G1 is epistatic to G3, that means G1's expression masks or determines G3’s phenotypic expression. But I'm not sure. If both are required and in redundancy, perhaps they are not epistatic. Maybe the wording isn't precise.

Alternatively, looking at option C):

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure that's the key here.

Hmm, or perhaps 'pleiotropic' is not the right term here as the TS doesn't suggest multiple traits but multiple genes.

Alternatively, may be saying that they have multiple roles.

If G2 is the TF, epistatic to G1, because without G2, G1's effect is irrelevant—so g1g2 is the same as g2.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1’s presence would mask G3's effects. But in the data, when both are knocked out, it's much worse (10% < 50% or 75%).

So if in presence of G1 (g3:50, WT: but without G1), no, this is getting murky.

Alternatively, thinking of epistatic hierarchy:

If G2 is the initial regulatory gene, then no other factors or mutations can 'override' its effect. So epistatic towards others.

Thus, looking for which option has G2 as the TF and epistatic to others.

Looking at the options:

A: G1 is TF → that is incorrect, because their data suggests G2 is the cause for highest susceptibility.

B: G2 is TF, in the same promoter (not sure about this), but suggests G3 is epistatic to G1. Doubtful as without G2, both KD give 0%→ so G2 is epistatic.

C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is towards G3.

D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if G1 is epistatic, it would mean that G1’s function is upstream, and G3 would come downstream. In that case, knocking G1 would  cause more severe effects if G3 is downstream.

But according to the data, knocking G3 (g3) leads to 50% resistance which is worse than g1 (75%).

Hmm, no. If G3 is downstream, G3's knockout causing worse effect doesn't fit. Maybe they're analogous in their positions.

Thus, let's try to find which option fits based on our initial analysis.

Remember: 

In the dataset, the only gene where its knockout leads to 0% resistance is G2.

Double KO of g1g3 produces 10% resistance (more susceptible than either alone). So each gene must contribute to the resistance in an additive way when both are present, but G2 is upstream.

So characteristic is that G2 is the master regulatory gene, giving a severe reduction in resistance when non-functional. 

Probably, the correct answer is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are functioning in a redundant (or additive) way.

Now, looking at the options, we can eliminate some options:

Option A: says G1 is the TF. But from the data, g2 is a knockout with much more pronounced effect (0 compared to g1's 75), so G2 is the TF, not G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, same promoter for G1 and G3.—Don't know about same promoter but seems unlikely—Same promoter would suggest they're in same operon, but the data doesn't require that. Also, in B, G3 is epistatic to G1. From data, when you have G2 working, and both G1 and G3, it seems neither is epistatic to the other without G2.

I'm not sure, let's think. Epistatic means that the effect of one gene is dependent onanother. For G3 epistatic to G1: could that imply a downstream relationship? Because, if you have G1 not functioning, you'd need G3 to be present for a minimal resistance.

But in g3's case, the resistance is lower than g1's.

Alternatively, how about the idea that when both G1 and G3 are off, the resistance is additive—each contributes something. So if each contributes 75% and 50%, the combined would be 125%, but that would be more than 100% which is unphysical. So perhaps the resistance levels are not additive but multiplicative. 0.75 (g1) * 0.5 (g3) = 0.375 or 37.5%? No, but data says 10% is what is not matching. Hmm, this model might not fit.

But data shows that when both are removed (g1g3), resistance is 10% which can't explain multiplicative or additive.

This is tricky; perhaps geneticists would model it as 0.75 + 0.5 -0.75*0.5 = 0.8175 which is 81.75%, but nope, not fitting.

Hmm, maybe the functions are independent in a so-called dosage model.

Another angle: perhaps each gene (G1 and G3) contributes 50% each, and  together add 75%. But our data says in g1g3 DOF leads to 10%—lower than either.

Hmm no that doesn't fit. Sigh, perhaps taking another approach—the results given.

The data suggests that all double mutants (g1g2, g2g3, g1g2) are 0% resistance, identical to g2, suggesting G2 is epistatic to all others. 

In addition, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than when either is knocked out alone (75% and 50%).

This suggests that G2 is the initial master switch, and G1 and G3 are 'secondary' downstream in a way that, their individual contributions are additive when both are functioning.

But perhaps it's that G2 activates both G1 and G3. Each of G1 and G3 may function in a partially redundant or additive fashion. So the presence of both together aid higher resistance than either alone. But in our data: g1:75%, g3:50%, which is not higher than either. So that's confusing.

Wait delay, perhaps G2 is the TF needed for both, but when expressed, each of G1 and G3 contribute:

So total resistance = G1 + G3.

If both are present (WT): 100% (G1=75%, G3=50%, but perhaps additive to 125%, which is impossible. So this contradicts. So perhaps the resistance model isn't additive.

Alternatively, maybe it's each of G1 and G3 being simultaneously required steps in a different pathway. So if either is missing, the resistance drops, but perhaps becomes worse when both are gone. Wait, but without G2, the resistance is already 0%—so generations are not contributing anything.

In conclusion, the initial idea is that G2 is the transcription factor, acting upstream of G1 and G3. Without G2 (g2), you get 0% resistance. Without G1 (g1), you retain some resistance from G3 at 75%, which is not matching. Wait, no. In data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is lower than WT, but higher than g3. If G3 is such that when absent, you get only 50%, perhaps G1 contributes more.

So when G2 is present, everyone is active.

G1 and G3 may add to the resistance. So 75% for g1 suggests in the presence of g2, they can express G3. Wait, but previously I would have thought that in the presence of G2, G1 and G3 are both active. If G1 is knocked out, then G3 still active, perhaps leading to worse enhancement of resistance? But not sure.

Another possibility: the genes are on a hierarchical pathway. So without G2, everything is offs. G2 activation allows G1's expression, which in turn activates G3.

Therefore, the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3. In this case, in the double mutant g1g3: it would require both G1 and G3 to be knocked out, but G2 is present; since G3 is a descendant of G2's function.

Wait but if the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3, then in g1, G3 is not expressed, so the resistance comes only from G1? But in reality, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which would be less than in WT (100% plus any...

Hmm, no. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should find which options fit.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, and G1 is epistatic → says G1's upstream of G3.

 that would mean G3 requires G1 for its function. If G1 is knocked out, then G3 cannot function (but in the data, when G3 is knocked out, you have 50%, suggesting that G1 is functioning here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel but both depend on G2.

In this case, gene redundancy would imply that you can lose either, but not both. Because losing one (say, G1), gives 75% resistance (with G3 still active at 50%). Wait actually g1 has 75% resistance: which is worse than g3 which has 50% resistance? So that the contributions of G1 and G3 are non-additive.

Wait this doesn't make immediate sense.ickening.

Alternatively, perhaps the plants require that either the product of G1 or G3 is present. So as long as either gene is present, you have some resistance. Double knockout removes both, therefore worse.

But in this case, when only G1 is present (g3 knockout), you have 75% of the resistance. If G3 knockout has 50%, that implies that G3 provides more resistance than G1.

So without G3 may only give 50% which is (assuming) that G1 provides more when its present.

But if this is redundancy, you have a bit, but that seems in opposite.

Wait perhaps G2's T factors activate G1 and G3. So without G1 (g1), G3 is active, giving some resistance. If G2 is removed (g2), even G3 is not active, so the plant is super susceptible.

In this scenario, the fact that g1g3's resistance is even lower (10%) than g3 alone suggests that in addition to G3, G1 provides a different or complementary pathway.

So when both are present, you have higher resistance (100%). Each alone provides some (G3:50, G1:75). So possibly, they are each part of same pathway but contribute together additively.

But this brings us back to the question of redundancy or additive functions. 

But in this earlier data:

With all this confusion, the satisfactory pick is most likely D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Explanation from data points:

If G1 and G3 are redundant, so when one is knocked out, the other still provides some resistance. But their double KOs cause more severe phenotypes. 

g1 causes 75%, g3 causes 50%, which suggests G1's redundancy is better (or it contributes more to resistance than G3). Thus, why then would their double knockout (g1g3) cause a resistance of 10%? If they are redundant, this would imply that the other isn’t redundant, but their actions perhaps provide additive more. So their combined absence is worse.

Moreover, in the D option, it says G1 is epistatic to G3 if, say, G1 is upstream of G3. E.g., G1 must be functioning for G3's product to take effect.

Wait other thoughts. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype observed in the presence of g1 would indicate that G3 can't contribute. But the data says g3 has 50% so without G3, some resistance still remains.

Hmm difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy might imply that G1 and G3 influence multiple traits.

Okay, this is taking much longer than I thought.

In sum, the correct answer is likely option C or D. Considering the double mutants (g1g3 shows 10%, which si more severe than g1 or g3 alone), both G1 and G3 contribute, and perhaps are additive or redundant.

After all that, based on the data I'm seeing that G2 is the TF upstream, and G1 and G3 are for redundancy but G's differs in their contributions. So when both are KO, the resistance drops more, which wouldn't happen if they're completely redundant; unless the metals add up to >50%. 

Alternatively, thinking that G2 is the master, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But perhaps more accurately, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 shows pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic.

But I'm getting stuck. 

Since time is pressing for me, let me conclude that the likely answer is option C—in that G2 is the TF and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, in the options:

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So the answer would be C.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps no. Think from raw data.

g2: 0% → without G2.

g1g2: 0% → no change from loss of g2.

Same with g3g2.

Thus, presence of G2 is required for any resistance. So with G2 not present, nothing.

Now, in the g1 and g3 single KOs:

g1:75% → which still requires G2 activating G3. Because without G1, but G2 is active (g1 is knocking only G1).

Wait if G1 is redundant, G3 would still give 50%, but in g1 it's not 50%—it's 75%, which is higher than in g3.

Therefore, G1 may regulate or contribute to another gene that gives it better resistance when G1 is the only downstream.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is not redundant with G3. What if G1 directly mediates part of the resistance, and G3 acts through another pathway.

But this is not mere redundancy but two different parallel pathways.

But in that case, knockouts of both give 10%, implying more severe.

Don'toverthink, the correct option is option C.

But I'm really not sure, perhaps the correct option is D.

But looking at the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy—so when both are knocked out, effect is worse than either alone: which matches g1g3's 10% which is worse than 50 or 75.

In the case of redundancy, he g3 mutant, with 50% resistance, would have redundancy with G1. If G1 is also knocked out, the combined effect would be much worse. So ther double Knockout's rate is 10%; in non-redundant, it might be just the same.

Therefore, D option—so the conclusion is G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Now, epistatic towards: perhaps that G1 is epistatic to G3 because G1's effect is upstream, so when G1 is KO, it masks G3's effect.

OR, perhaps the reasoning is that when G1 is present, G3’s contribution isn't necessary because another gene (stituted?) is doing the job.

Alternatively, in our case, KOs of G1 and G3 lead to resistances suggesting G1 contributes more.

I think perhaps the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing the interaction of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The experiment involves knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3), with resistance levels measured as percentages of the wild-type (WT) resistance. The key data points are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance (reduced by 25% compared to WT)
- **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible)
- **g3**: 50% resistance (reduced by 50% compared to WT)
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2)
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2)
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either g1 or g3 alone)

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **G2 as a Transcription Factor (TF):**
   - The knockout of G2 (g2) results in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is a critical upstream regulator. Without G2, downstream genes (likely G1 and G3) cannot be activated, leading to complete susceptibility.

2. **Double Mutants Involving G2:**
   - The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, identical to g2. This demonstrates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2's function is upstream and masks the effects of G1 and G3 when it is non-functional.

3. **Single Knockouts of G1 and G3:**
   - The g1 mutant retains 75% resistance, suggesting that G1 contributes to resistance but is not essential on its own.
   - The g3 mutant retains only 50% resistance, indicating that G3 contributes less to resistance compared to G1.

4. **Double Knockout of G1 and G3 (g1g3):**
   - The resistance drops to 10%, worse than either single knockout. This suggests that G1 and G3 provide additive contributions to resistance when both are present. Their combined absence leads to a severe reduction in resistance.

5. **Redundancy Between G1 and G3:**
   - The presence of redundancy would explain why the double mutant (g1g3) has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. However, the resistance levels do not align with perfect redundancy, as G1 and G3 contribute differently to resistance (75% for g1 vs. 50% for g3).

6. **Epistasis Between G1 and G3:**
   - The data suggests that G1 is epistatic to G3. This means that the function of G1 may influence or mask the effect of G
