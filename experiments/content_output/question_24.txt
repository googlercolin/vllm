Question: If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.
Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.
A) 16
B) 18
C) 22
D) 12

Assistant Response:
To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the given information:

1. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water.
2. Heating and treating with platinum results in mixture Y, where mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water.
3. Mixture Y, upon hydrogenation, results in a single hydrocarbon Z, which is a constituent of mixture Y.
4. Hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%.

From the information, we know that the mass fraction of hydrogen (H) in Z is 14.28%. The molecular formula of Z could be derived from this information. The molecular formula of a hydrocarbon that fits the mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28% is C7H16 because:

- Molecular weight of C7H16 = (7 * 12) + (16 * 1) = 84 + 16 = 100
- Mass fraction of H = (16 / 100) * 100 = 16%

However, Z might be C6H14 because:

- Molecular weight of C6H14 = (6 * 12) + (14 * 1) = 72 + 14 = 86
- Mass fraction of H = (14 / 86) * 100 ≈ 16.28%, which is close to 14.28%.

Since the substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y, and it is formed from the hydrogenation of mixture Y, we infer that mixture Y consists of hydrocarbons similar to Z. Therefore, both liquids in mixture X, when hydrogenated, contribute to the formation of Z (C6H14 or similar).

Given that the molecules of the compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds, they must be alkenes that decolorize bromine water. When hydrogenated, each alkene in mixture X forms a corresponding alkane (for example, C6H12 + H2 → C6H14). So, each alkene in mixture X contributes 12 hydrogen atoms to the final product (C6H14 or similar).

Since the mixture is equimolar, the two alkenes in X each provide 12 hydrogen atoms (after hydrogenation). Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is:

12 (from the first alkene) + 12 (from the second alkene) = 24 hydrogen atoms.

However, reviewing the options, the closest and correct choice based on the information given (assuming the simplest form of Z, C6H14) is:

Answer: C
