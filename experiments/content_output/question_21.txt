Question: Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).
A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Assistant Response:
<think>
Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. Okay, the question is about isomers and tautomerism, as well as optical isomerism. Let me think.

The first part (A) says, among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. Hmm. Oh wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift the position of hydrogen and electrons, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, which of these two compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinone—wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other. Because quinones have that structure where you have a benzene ring with two ketone groups that are conjugated. So structure-wise, benzoquinone has two ketone groups next to each other. If there are adjacent carbonyls, can they undergo enol tautomerism? I think that generally for enol tautomerism, you need a structure where a hydrogen is alpha to a carbonyl, so that it can tautomerize through a conjugated system.

But wait, benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4=O. So in that case, the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene, but there's no alpha carbon with hydrogens, because the carbonyl is directly attached to the ring. So in that case, can it undergo enol tautomerism? I'm thinking no. Because there's no alpha H present because both carbons are part of the benzene ring. So if you don't have an alpha H adjacent to the carbonyl, then no tautomerism.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For a compound to tautomerize, it needs adjacent H atoms to the carbonyl groups. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are on benzene, which is sp² hybridized, so each carbon is part of the ring, and any position adjacent to ketone would be another ring carbon. So the oxygen is double bonded to the C which is in turn double bonded to the benzene ring. In that case, there's no H attached to that C. Therefore, no alpha H. So tautomerism isn't possible, hence benzenequinone doesn't exhibit it.

But wait the other compound is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three keto groups at positions 1,3,5. Wait, so the structure would be O=C-O-C-O6? No, wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a 6-membered ring with carbonyl groups at every other carbon. Let me imagine it. Each of those carbonyls would be on positions 1,3,5. So each of these positions is a carbonyl, connected to the cyclohexane ring. And the carbonyl groups are separated by single bonds.

So in this structure, each carbonyl has adjacent carbons (the positions 2 and 6 relative to position 1, for example), which are themselves CH₂ groups perhaps. So each of these would have alpha hydrogens. Hence, the compound can undergo enol tautomerism. Like how diketones such as 1,3-diketones can tautomerize, but maybe a tricyclic with three adjacent ketones would not, or maybe in this case, it would?

Wait, but wait. If the structure isn't such that the enol form is possible. Let me think of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is at 1,3,5, and between them, the ring goes on, so each ketone is separated by a CH₂ unit. For example, ring positions: C1 (O), C2 (CH2), C3 (O), C4 (CH₂), etc. So each C adjacent to a keto group (like C2 and C6, C4 and C8 in another cycle but in a cyclohexane, they just alternate) would have hydrogens. So on C2, there are two H's attached, right? Wait, in a 6-membered ring for a trione, like 1,3,5-trione, which is probably a fully substituted cyclohexane with three alternating carbonyl groups. So each of the remaining carbons would have two CH₂ groups, except if there's a bridge or something. No, probably each non-carbonyl carbon is a bridge. Wait, maybe I should draw this.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a six-membered ring where every alternate carbon is a ketone. So positions: 1 is O, 2 is CH₂, 3 is O, 4 is CH₂, 5 is O, 6 is CH₂? No, cyclohexane only has six carbons in the ring. So 1,3,5 positions are all ketones, and 2,4,6 are CH₂ groups maybe. So yes, those CH₂ are next to the carbonyl groups. So on each of these CH₂ carbons, there are two H's.

But wait wait, cyclohexane is a six-member benzene-like ring, but it's cyclohexane not benzene, so each corner is CH to something. Wait, no, cyclohexane is all CH2's, or in this case, some would be carbonyl groups.

So when in 1,3,5-trione, rings are like O=C-O-C-O-(in a ring). For each O=C, the adjacent positions are CH₂. So the carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5, and between them are CH₂. So those CH₂ groups have two H each. So when the molecule is in a form like that, because each alpha carbon (the CH₂'s) are adjacent to a carbonyl, then the compound indeed can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So when one of the CH₂ groups loses a H and forms a double bond, creating an enol form.

So for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule has alpha Hs because the CH₂ groups are adjacent to carbonyls. So that compound can undergo tautomerism, right?

Then, among the two (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione), which doesn't show tautomerism?

Benzoquinone, I thought, can't because it has no alpha H. While the trione has alpha Hs and can tautomerize.

Wait, but then part A says which does not show tautomerism. So in this case, benzoquinone is option A, as it doesn't have alpha H and can't tautomerize, so the correct a is A is benzoquinone. Wait, but wait. No, the statement says 'does not show tautomerism (A)'.

So problem (A) is identifying which one doesn't have tautomerism. We have two options: benzoquinone (maybe doesn't) and cyclohexane-trione (maybe does). The correct A would thus be benzoquinone, so (A = benzoquinone). So during this part, Part A, where the statement is among the options, the A for tautomerism is benzoquinone. So (A) is benzoquinone, because it doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

So moving to part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a chiral center is present. So which of these compounds is chiral? Let me examine each.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's model its structure. 2-Hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: 

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. But as the methyl ester, it's CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. Wait, for (sodium) 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂COO^- but perhaps with the ester group. Actually, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3? Or is it another arrangement? Wait, structurally: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon. So it's HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no—wait, propanoic acid: CH2CH2? Oh, wait let me get this right.

Okay, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The structure is carboxylic acid with two carbons. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoate. So it's on the middle carbon next to the COO- group.

Wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, more accurately, it's CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3.

Wait, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's imagine the central carbon has four different groups. The carbon in question is the middle CH2(OH). So I need to look at the groups attached to that carbon.

Wait, the skeletal structure is: O=C-OCH3 connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Let me lay it out.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoic acid is:

H2C-COOH

But at position 2 (the middle carbon), a hydroxyl is added—so structure is HC-OH-CH2COOH. So perhaps something like: O-ch2-ch(ch2ooh). Wait, maybe better to write it as follows:

The ester is -OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. The rest of the chain is: (CH2CH(OH)CH3).

Wait, let me try again. The ester group is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl, so the carboxylic acid part is methyl ester, so structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3. But wait, more accurately, the ester is on the third carbon.

Wait, propanoic acid is (CH2)2COOH. So methyl ester would be (CH2)2CO-OCH3. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, that's (CH(OH)CH2)COOCH3? Hmm.

Wait perhaps that's correct. If the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the chain is: methyl (CO-OCH3), the next carbon is the one with OH?

Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate group. So, the propanoate is CH2CHOHCOO^- (but esterified). Wait, let's do the numbering.

Propanoic acid is 1: C-1 (COOH), C-2 (CH2), C-3 (CH3). Wait no: propanoic acid is CH₂CH₂COOH? No, it's CH3CH2COOH. So C-1 is the COOH group, C-2 is the CH2 adjacent to it, and C-3 is the terminal CH3. Wait, but numbering starts from the COOH end.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: hydroxyl is on C-2, the middle CH2 group. So structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So when it's a methyl ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2OH-CH2-COOOCH3.

Now, does any carbon in this molecule have four different groups attached?

Looking at the structure: The middle CH2 (since it's CH2OH and CH2COOCH3). But wait, each attached CH2 group is connected to parts with different substituents. Let's check. The OH is on a CH2 group.

So, for the CH2 adjacent to COOCH3, the carbon is the central C where the functional groups are.

Wait, let's count the groups attached to that carbon.

Wait, let's structure it as:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3

Wait, so perhaps the CH2 is connected to:

1. A OH group (CH2OH on one side)

2. A CH2 group on the other (wait, no, the CH2 is central, so wait. Let me write its environment.

Wait, the central CH₂ is in between CH₂OH and CH₂COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

- One H (if it's a CH₂ group but maybe not), but no, the CH₂ group itself is.

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Perhaps it's the carbon bearing the OH and being adjacent to the COOCH3 group. Wait, perhaps I should visualize it. The carbon with OH is CH2OH and attached to another CH2 which is attached to the COOCH3 group. So the groups attached to the central CH2OH may not exhibit chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (around C2 in 2-hydroxypropanoate) is the one with four substituents. Let me see.

Alternative structure: The molecule is (HOCH2)CH₂COOCH3. No, wait the structure may not have a chiral center because perhaps the substituents are similar on adjacent carbons.

Wait, let's get a better approach. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, not possible. So perhaps the backbone is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Ah wait, no. The correct structural formula should be: the methyl ester is on the COO- group, so the methyl is on the carbonyl. Next is the second carbon (CH2), which then leads to the third carbon (CH2OH). Wait, that would make the structure:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

So in that case, the central carbon (CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2OH) would be symmetric if the two CH2 groups on either side are identical. So let's look again.

The molecule in such case would have the structure:

COO⁻(CH3) is attached to a CH2, then another CH2 with an OH.

Wait, so the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the same carbon as the CH2, which is next to the COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe it's better to look at a different compound.

Wait, another approach. The question is about whether the compound has optical isomerism, which requires the presence of a chiral center. So, which of the given molecules have a chiral center?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait:

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.

So,

- Propanoate ester, say, methyl, would be CH3CH2CO-OCH3.

Wait, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle (second) carbon. Thus, the structure would be: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, is that right? Looking at the structure: the two CH2 groups adjacent to the COOCH3.

So, if the COOCH3 is on the third carbon, then the structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂CH₂OOCCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think I should imagine the propanoate as follows:

Numbering the carbons as 1 (COOCH3 group), 2 (CH2), and 3 (CH3, but with OH instead). Hmm, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So that's the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

In this case, the structure has CH2(OH) and CH2 connected. The question is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's look at each carbon.

The carbonyl is at the end (COOCH3). The next carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. The middle CH2 is attached to another CH2 which has OH. Wait, but wait, this structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So what’s the connectivity? 

So, the CH2(OH) is attached to another CH₂, which is attached to COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3. Is there a chiral center in this structure?

Looking at each carbon:

- COOCH3 is a carbonyl group; the adjacent carbon is CH₂.
- The next carbon (CH₂) is connected to two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. Wait, the CH₂ between COOCH3 and CH₂OH would be connected to COOCH3 on one side, and two H's, then one CH₂OH group.

Wait, perhaps in this compound, the middle CH₂ (the one connected to the COOCH3 and the CH₂OH) is a chiral center. Let me imagine:

The central carbon is attached to:

1. CH2OH
2. CH2 which connects to COOCH3
3. Plus two H's?

Wait, no, perhaps another way: Maybe the central carbon is the one we're looking at.

Wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is: 

O
||O        OCH3
   O-C-O-R (R = methyl)
   |
CH2-C-O-H

Wait, another approach: perhaps, in the molecule, the carbon where CH₂ is attached to both COOCH3 and to the hydroxyl isn't a chiral center because the other groups might be non-identical.

Wait, let's check each group.

At the central carbon connected to the groups: 

CH₂-COOCH3 and CH₂OH.

Wait, the carbons in the structure:

Carbon A (with COOCH3) → Carbon B → Carbon C (with OH).

So Carbon B is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (A and C? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe I got the structure wrong. Methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. That would mean the OH is on a CH₂ that's adjacent to a CH₂ connected to COOCH3. So chiral center there? No, because the groups attached may not be four distinct ones.

Wait, the structure could be: 

HOCH₂CH₂COOCH3.

So the HO is on the first CH₂, leaving the next and the COOCH3. Let's check the central carbon. For example, the four groups attached would be:

1. H
2. CH2OH
3. CH2– ?
Wait, perhaps not. The central CH2 would be CH2, not a carbon (wait, because all the CH2 groups in that structure only have two H and the connecting groups). I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to think about whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

Another compound to consider: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO₂CCHCHCO₂Methyl (in a trans configuration). But as dimethyl fumarate, it's O=C(CH3)-CH-CH-CO(CH3)-O. The two methyl groups on each end, with double bond in between. So, is that structure?

Wait, more accurately, it's: 

O       O
||     ||
C - CH₂-CH₂ - C
   ||     ||
   OMe   OMe

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is actually (Z) or (E)? No, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleic acid, so when it's dimethyl ester, it would have two fumarate groups, but the trans double bond.

Wait, structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O=C-(CH₂)₂-CO-O...

Wait, perhaps better as:

 each end would be CH-CH arranged to create the trans. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Actually, fumarate is the trans-diestereomer of maleic acid. So in the ester, the structure would have the double bond between two CH that each are attached to two ester groups.

Structure: The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-CO-O?
No, wait. Let me correct. Each double bond end has an ester group. For fular ester, it's:

MeOOC-CH₂-CH2-COO-Me in trans.

No, no, because fumarate is the trans isomer. I think the correct structure is MeOOCCH=CHCOOCH3, but wait, that's not the correct structure because fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H. Wait, no that's maleic/ fumaric?

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H. When you make the dimethyl ester, the four ester groups are derived.

Wait, really, I'm getting mixed up with the structure. Let's just think about fumarate in terms of its stereochemistry.

The key takeaway is whether the compound has a chiral center or not, but in dimethyl fumarate, each side is identical due to the symmetry in the molecule, perhaps. Okay, on the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps, does or does not have chiral centers.

Wait, I remember that fumarate and maleate esters are often used as antigemmatory agents, and also that they can have diastereomers and enantiomers but perhaps not in every case.

Wait but dimethyl fumarate. Let's break it down. The structure is methyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CHCH-CO2H, with double bond in trans configuration.

In the ester form, both OH groups in fumaric acid are replaced by OMe. So the structure becomes (Z) or (E)?

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans structure. So that would be O
                              ||
O-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O (with methyl ester groups?)
Wait, let me be precise.

Actually, the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    ||
O=C -CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, that's perhaps not accurate. Let me think, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CHCH-CO₂H, trans configuration, so the four substituents around the double bond. Then, when it is esterified with methanol, each end becomes OCH3.

So the structure would be O=CHEsters. Wait, no. Let's reconsider. Actually, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But that's perhaps incorrect.

Wait, I think the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration. Oh, but wait, actually, maleic acid is cis double bond, and fumaric is trans. So dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond configured trans.

So the structure is: O
||O
O-C-CH-CH-OOC-O-methyl
           ||
           OCH3

Wait no.

Let me correct the structure:

Dimethyl fumarate should be CH2=CH connected to two ester groups.

Structure is:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O-C-OCH3?

No, no—correction. Fumarate's structure has four substituents around the double bond. For (E) isomer (fumaric acid), each end of the double bond has the ester groups. So the correct structure would be MeO2C-CH2-CH₂-CO2Me — No, that’s for succinic acid, perhaps.

Wait, I'm really getting stuck. Alternative plan.

Is dimethyl fumarate a symmetric molecule? 

Yes: because it's a disubstituted diester with identical groups on each side. If the double bond is between two CH groups each attached a COOCH3 group, then it's symmetric. If that's the case, then whether it has a chiral center depends. But wait, can enantiomers exist here?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then it's probably achiral. But wait, wait, would the double bond being trans in such a symmetrical structure make it chiral?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans structure. Let's imagine the groups: the central double bond.

Structure is:

O
||
O=C-(CH₂)-C-(=O)-OCH3

No, that’s not correct. Methyl ester groups. Let me consider that dimethyl fumarate has structure where the double bond is  (E), with each side having a ester group:

Structure: O
        ||
O=C-OCH3     O=C-OCH3
    \   /
     CH2
     || (but in trans configuration)
     /   \
O=C-OCH3     O=C-OCH3

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the structure. Maybe better to refer back to the concept.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps here's another approach. Whether a molecule shows optical isomerism is due to the presence of chiral centers, or maybe due to another type of isomerism like allömer (but that's more about tautomerism, not relevant here).

For part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate—which one exhibits optical isomerism (i.e., has enantiomers or diastereomers due to stereocenters). So the answer depends on whether either of them has a chiral center.

Let's go back.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the structure has a central carbon with four different substituents, then a chiral center exists.

In this compound, considering the structure: the centre in question is CH₂ where the OH is attached.

Wait: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So the backbone is:

OOCH3-C-O
        |
        CH2-CH2-OH?

No, tentatively, we can imagine the central carbon (the CH₂ that is between COOCH3 and CH2OH) as a potential chiral center. The four substituents there: 

- COOCH3 group on the upper side,

- a CH2OH group on one side,

- two other substituents: are they the same?

Wait, but is the C connected to one CH₂ and the other CH₂? Let me think.

Properly, the center's substituents are: (1) COOCH3, (2) CH2OH, (3) two H's on adjacent carbons.

Wait hang on, if it is:

CH(OH)CH2COOCH3 — no, perhaps the structure is CH₂(OH)-CH₂-CO-OCH3.

So, the carbon where the hydroxyl is:

So, O  
|  
H-C-OH  
... 

Wait, perhaps the H's are on the same carbon.

I think it's better to conclude that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center because the carbon attached to the hydroxyl and the ester groups might have four distinct substituents, making it a chiral center.

Alternatively, others may think that this carbon does not have four different groups because the groups may be mirror images or same, but I'm trying to think. So perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate—could it have a chiral center? Well, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure has two ester groups on opposite ends of a double bond. Thus, the molecule may be symmetrical, so any chiral centers would cause racemic or something else. Alternatively, in the trans arrangement, any present substituents could be symmetrical, making the compound achiral.

Wait, let me go back. For dimethyl fumarate:

Its structure is (E)-O=C-OCH3-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3. Is that it?

Alternatively, it's (E)-MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3. No, that's incorrect because fumarate is the trans ester, but methylened啬酸甲酯 structure is, for example, (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)₂?

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, in the trans configuration. So substituting each -OH in the carboxylic acid with OMe would give CH2(COOCH3)₂. So, O=C-(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-(C=O)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if the double bond is in the middle, with each end attached to both COOCH3 and perhaps CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps I should look for whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

Wait, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is symmetrical and all the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the double bond. So the molecule is achiral because it's symmetrical across the double bond axis. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, but others might.

But based on that—dunno, maybe I'm getting stuck. I think I have to move.

Based on these thoughts:

-Fur ( dimethyl fumarate) perhaps does not display optical isomerism as it’s symmetrical.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate probably does have a chiral center because the OH on a secondary carbon with four different substituents. Thus, it can exhibit optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate cannot because it is either symmetrical or maybe doesn’t have a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. No, another angle: in dimethyl fumarate, if the ester groups are on the same side, that would give a diastereomer, but if the structure is symmetrical, maybe even that. But in this case, I'm missing.

Now, I think the option B is whether it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (oryx) or dimethyl fumarate that exhibits optical isomerism.

But according to initial analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral centre (at the carbon bearing the OH), making it capable of optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate may not.

Therefore, Part B would have that methyl 2-HP... shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but I’ve got to think again. Remove confusion.

Wait another thought: does methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate have a molecule with a plane of symmetry? For instance, if the molecule is in a way that any stereogenic center is canceled out by symmetry elsewhere, making it actually not chiral.

Alternatively, suppose the structure is (R) configuration, but whether a plane prevents it from being a true chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a women's o r

Wait, another mistake: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is probably a -C(OH)- which is attached to two identical groups, thus not having a chiral center.

Ah! Suppose that the CH2 here is connected to two other CH2 groups. So whether the two groups on either side are the same. So perhaps the molecule has symmetry.

Wait, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

methoxycarbonyl (ester) attached to a CH2 group, next to a CH2OH group. So the molecule's central part is:

–CH₂–CH₂(OH)

But then again, the other end is the ester:

COOCH3.

Thus, looking at the central CH2 (attached to COOCH3 and CH2OH), the groups on this CH2 would be:

- COOCH3

- CH₂OH (but on one side)

- and two H's on the same CH2. Wait, but that makes the CH2 not a chiral center because two groups are same (two H's).

Wait, correct! So the central carbon—assuming it's a CH2—has the same attached groups.

So, if it's CH₂– attached to two H’s, two CH2's, then no. So that carbon only attached to COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H’s. No, it's attached to:

- One group: COOCH3,

- Another: CH₂OH,

- Plus two H’s.

But two H’s are identical. So, the groups would be H, H, (group with COOCH3), (group with CH2OH)—so not four different groups, just three.

Therefore, no chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Which suggests that it cannot form optical isomers.

But then, who can form optical isomers? Let's revisit Dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl f. has the structure where the two sides are (MeOOC-) and (CH2-) with a trans double bond arrangement.

Wait, but the molecule would have symmetry. So maybe no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: Does dimethyl fumarate have any stereogenic centers?

No, because in its structure, the molecule is symmetric. Each of the two ester groups is in a way that the molecule isn't chiral.

Alternatively, let me find this out practically.

Another thought: Did I mix up the compounds? Oh.

If the compound is maleic anhydride, yes—But in the options, it's dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, considering that maleic acid is cis and creates a molecule that doesn't have a plane of symmetry, but fumaric acid is trans—wait, but for esters, if the dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, perhaps it doesn’t have a chiral center.

Ok, another approach: if the structure of dimethyl fumarate has identical mirror images—but I where is the point.

But perhaps someone's diagram may help.

Alternatively, another way: for a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have four distinct substituent groups attached to a carbon.

In methyl 2-hy. propanoate:

Ester group   CH2-OH

But no, attached to carbons. Wait, carefully. Let's model the structure:

The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on a CH2 group, then a CH2 group between that and the ester. So the potential chiral centers are maybe the middle CH2.

But no, the middle CH2 is attached to both H's, so it's not a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the carbon bearing the hydroxyl (C2) is the one in question.

Wait, if the carbons are C1, C2, C3, and the ester is attached to C3.

Structure: C3 is COOCH3; C2 has OH; C1 (if any) perhaps is attached to another group.

Or, more accurately:

C1: COOCH3.

C2: CH2.

C3: CH2OH.

Wait, in propanoate ester, the substituents are:

Position 1: COOCH3

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH2OH.

Wait, but that would require more than three carbons, which is confusing.

Wait, let me write the structure again.

Propanoic acid is:

- CH₂CH₂COOH.

Well, but Propanoic acid is (from the ester), CH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that structure for methyl propanoate, then. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH) CH2 COOCH3.

So the structure is:

(HOCH2)–CH2–COOCH3.

So the central carbon here (middle CH₂) is attached to:

– HOCH2, 

– CH2 (another CH2 group), and

– two H's.

Wait, that's just three unique groups, because the two H’s are same, so that's two same, middle CH2 has two H's and two attached groups. Therefore, the middle CH could be attached to:

– CH2 HO,

– CH2 COOCH3,

– H,

– H.

So two H’s. Since at least two same substituents, it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral, right?

Ugh. This is getting confusing. 

Another molecule (dimethyl fumarate). Structure is:

Fumaric acid: (HO₂C)CH=CH(COOH) with E configuration. The esterification would replace both -OH with OMe groups, giving:

O=COCH3-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Each side of the double bond has a ester group. So:

OOCH3
|
O=C - CH=CH - C=O
    || 

Wait, that might not be possible. Ah, wait, if the structure is (E)-O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3, that would have both ends attached to OCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is.

O          O
||        ||
C-OCH3   C-OCH3 
    \   /
     CH₂
     || 
     CH₂
    /   \
O=C-OCH3   O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not possible.

Another approach: if the groups around the double bond are all the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, meaning it doesn't have chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ends of the double bond each have a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetric with respect to a midline. Hence, no chiral centers. So in both fumarate and 2-hypropanoate, perhaps neither has a chiral center. But from earlier analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure may have a chiral center but our analysis was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I am mixing both compounds:

Wait, the other initial part Q was about which does not have tautomerism. For part A, option D was a (benzoquinone, dimethyl fumarate) as options.

Wait, coming back: For part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

If neither compound has optical isomerism, but this can't be right.

Wait, another approach: Draw both structures.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

Structure: CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

Chirality? On C2, that is, the CH₂ group with OH. Here's the structure:

Est tako... Wait, the OH is on the second carbon.

So, the arrangement would be:

COOCH3—CH₂—CH₂—OH.

Wait, no!

Wait, no. The propionic ester would have three carbons, right? So, position 1 is COOCH3, position 2 is CH₂ with OH, and position 3 is something.

Wait, perhaps another way: Coating as follows.

Number the carbons as follows:

1: COOCH3.

2: CH₂OH.

3: another CH2.

Wait, But three carbons? Wait, maybe not. Propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, no.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's better to accept that for dimethyl fumarate, the structure doesn't have any chiral centers due to symmetry. Thus, part B would imply only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, another point of view: Is there any possibility that dimethyl fumarate can't have optical isomerism because it's a dissymmetric molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree. Alternatively, I should select the answer option based on whether A being benzoquinone, which does not exhibit tautomerism (so is option B).

Looking back, in the options given:

Option D:
A = benzoquinone
B = dimethyl fumarate.

But from above, we had:

A) A is benzoquinone, which is correct.

Part B: which between the two exhibits optical isomerism? Assuming that the answer is B is dimethyl fumarate. Then, dimethyl fumarate.

Wait why? Because in this case, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-oc than maleate which is (Z). [Wrote dimethyl fumarate as option B showing optical.]

Wait forgot whether fumarate can have meso form, maybe.

Wait if dimethyl fumarate were a meso compound. Is it possible?

 If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be a meso compound and achiral, despite having two stereocenters.

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have four stereogenic centers but rather the double bond ends determine that.

Wait, if the molecule is E and each end is symmetric with same groups, that would not contribute to stereoisomerism because of symmetrical substitution. Since there are no chiral centers, but considering double bond may have E,Z config ( but in this case, fumarate is E) but because of symmetry, it may not have (optical) isomerism.

Wait, I’m getting unclear. But the conclusion is: the correct options are part A = B ( Benzoquinone is answer A), and Part B would select dimethyl fumarate as the one that can show optical isomerism.

Looking back at the given choices:

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B= dimethyl fumarate.

If that's the case, then that's the correct option.

Perfect!

Answer: D
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the principles of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone has a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the benzene ring, and there are no alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism (keto-enol tautomerism) is not possible. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three alternating carbonyl groups. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha carbons) have hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-C(OH
