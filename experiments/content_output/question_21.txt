Question: Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).
A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Assistant Response:
Let's break down each part of the question to find the correct answer.

### A) Tautomerism and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione
Tautomerism involves the reversible interconversion of constitutional isomers of a compound through a equilibrium involving a proton transfer and/or a ring-opening/closure process. 

- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** (also commonly known as tricarballyldehyde) does not typically undergo tautomerism. It is a simple ketone and does not show such behavior.

### B) Optical Isomerism in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate
Optical isomerism (enantiomers, diastereomers) occurs in molecules with chiral centers.

- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also known as 2-hydroxypropionic acid) can exhibit optical isomerism. It has a chiral carbon atom, which leads to the formation of enantiomers.
- **Dimethyl fumarate** is an unsymmetrical dicarboxylic acid and potentially can form enantiomers due to the presence of chiral centers. However, its structural arrangement does not typically exhibit optical isomerism in the simplest form.

Given that both options could theoretically be correct for B, letâ€™s double-check by considering the core of the question.

### Correcting the Logic for B:
- **Dimethyl fumarate** actually shows enantiomerism due to the presence of a chiral carbon in the fumarate moiety, making it a plausible candidate for showing optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer aligns with:

- **A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The combination here fits into option **C**.

Answer: C
