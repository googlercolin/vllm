Question: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)
Find the energy spectrum.
A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))
B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))
C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)
D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))

Assistant Response:
To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle in the given potential, we need to analyze the potential function and see how it can be separated into angular and radial parts. 

The potential is given by:
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \frac{3}{2} k r^2 \cos^2(\theta) \]
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \frac{3}{2} k r^2 \left(\frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}\right) \]
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \frac{3}{4} k r^2 + \frac{3}{4} k r^2 \cos(2\theta) \]
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4} k r^2 + \frac{3}{4} k r^2 \cos(2\theta) \]

This potential can be separated into a radial part and an angular part. The radial part of the Schrödinger equation remains a harmonic oscillator potential, and the angular part simplifies to a term that depends on the angle and its multiples.

The energy levels for a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:
\[ E = \hbar \omega (n_x + n_y + 1) \]
where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

However, because of the additional term in the potential, we need to adjust for the extra \( \frac{3}{4} k r^2 \cos(2\theta) \) term, which contributes to the energy in a way that can be considered an effective increase in the level.

Given the options, we can see that the term \(\frac{3}{4} k r^2 \cos(2\theta)\) likely translates to an additional factor in the energy spectrum that is somewhat analogous to the term in the options.

The correct energy spectrum, accounting for the modified potential, should be:
\[ E = \hbar \omega (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \]
\[ E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
Answer: C
