Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = ½ kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm. I remember that potentials like this can sometimes be expressed in terms of effective potentials, or maybe rearrange terms to recognize the form.

Wait, I think the key here is to see if this potential can be split into radial and angular parts so that the problem simplifies into something separable. If that's possible, maybe we can treat each part as a one-dimensional oscillator.

Breaking down the potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out r²: V = r² [1/2 k + (3k/2) cos²θ]. Hmm. So does this lead us somewhere?

I remember that for a potential like this, especially in two dimensions using polar coordinates, when it depends on cos²θ, sometimes that can be expressed in terms of simpler trigonometric identities. Like, I know that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So let's try that substitution.

Substituting into the potential: V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Calculating that, I have:

(1/2) kr² = k r² * (1/2), and (3/2)kr² ((1 + cos2θ)/2) becomes (3k r² /4)(1) + (3k r² /4)cos2θ. So adding both terms: V = (1/2 + 3/4)k r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Simplifying the constants: 1/2 is 0.5 and 3/4 is 0.75, so 0.5 + 0.75 = 1.25 = 5/4. So, V = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Wait, but does that change how the problem is approached? Because now the potential separates a bit into a function of r and a function of θ. So maybe we can separate the Hamiltonian.

The total Hamiltonian in 2D is H = p²/(2m) + V(r,θ). Let's see about using polar coordinates (r, θ). Then each term would have derivatives in r and θ.

Expanding the kinetic energy term: H kin = (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r²)(∂/∂r)(r ∂/∂r) ) + (1/(r² sin²θ))(∂²/∂θ²) ) ]. 

Now the potential is  (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ. So, putting it all together, the potential is r² times ( 5k/4 + (3k/4) cos2θ ). That seems a bit complicated, but maybe there's a coordinate transformation that can simplify this.

Wait, I recall that sometimes functions of cos2θ can be approached by transforming to other variables, perhaps like elliptic coordinates or something else. Or maybe try to express the potential in terms of x and y, though not sure.

Let me see. If I express cos2θ in terms of x and y. Cos2θ is (x² - y²)/(x² + y²), right? Or in polar coordinates, cos2θ = (r² x² - r² y²)/(r^4) since cosθ = x/r and sinθ=y/r, so cos^2θ = (x² + y²)/(r²). Hmm maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps if I recognize that the particle’s motion might separate into oscillatory modes in different directions.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps treat this as a central potential plus a perturbation, but I'm not sure about that. Or, maybe if the potential is separable in terms of some other coordinates.

Another thought: Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of different coordinates. Let me see, if I consider a change of variables or a shift in the angular coordinate.

Wait, perhaps changing variables to θ' = 2θ? Because the potential has cos²θ which is equivalent to cos2θ in some fashion. But let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution such that u = cosθ. But that might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted variable. Let's take another approach.

The total potential is V(r, θ) = [ (5/4) ] k r² + [ (3/4) k r² ] cos2θ. Hmm.

But wait, could the potential be expressed as a sum of two quadratics in different angular components?

Let me try to write V(r,θ) as r² [ (5/4 k) + (3/4 k) cos2θ ]

But 5/4 is equal to 2 times (5/8/(2))^2 ? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the angular momentum or some kind of centrifugal barrier.

Wait a minute, for a central potential (V depends on r only), the energy levels are determined by the radial part. But here, the potential has a θ dependence as well, so this adds angular components into the picture.

But since the Hamiltonian doesn't seem to commute with angular momentum (unless for certain cases), the problem might not be separable in the way I was thinking.

Wait, perhaps there's a transformation we can make. Maybe polar coordinates could be adapted into something else. Another thought: Could I use a different set of coordinates where the potential becomes diagonal?

Hmm, perhaps using the fact that cos2θ can be expressed as a function of spherical harmonics or something, but that's getting complicated.

Let me approach this differently. Think about the form of the potential: r²[ a + b cos2θ ]. Let's say a = 5/4 k, b =3/4 k.

Wait, perhaps this is something to do with a particle undergoing harmonic oscillations. Because when you have a potential that looks like r² multiplied by a function that depends on angles, you can sometimes separate it into different modes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as a sum of squares in orthogonal directions. Let me think about how to decompose the cos2θ term into products such that the potential can be expressed as terms proportional to something like x² and y².

Wait, in Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. So, cos^2θ = cos²θ = (x²)/(r²). Similarly, cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ = (x² - y²)/r².

So, the potential can be written as (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r²)(x² - y²)/(r²). Wait, that might not help unless I recompute.

Wait, sorry, if V= [5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ], the second part is (3k/4) cos2θ. So, let me re-express it in terms of x and y.

So, since cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r² (because cos2θ = cos^2θ - sin^2θ = (x² - y²)/ (x² + y²) )

Wait, that's because x = r cosθ, y=r sinθ. So x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ. So (x² - y²)=r² (cos^2θ - sin^2θ) = r² cos2θ. Hence, cos2θ = (x² - y^2)/ r².

So substituting back into the potential:

V = (5k/4) r² + (3k/4) (x² - y²)

Because cos2θ = (x² - y²)/(r²). But here, since r² is x² + y^2, the potential becomes V = (5k/4)(x² + y²) + (3k)/(4)(x² - y²).

Let me recast that into separate terms:

V = [ (5k/4)x² + (5k/4) y² ] + [ (3k/4) x² - (3k/4 ) y² ]

Combine like terms:

x² terms: (5k/4 + 3k/4 )= (8k/4 )= 2k.

y² terms: (5k/4 -3k/4 )= (2k/4) = k/2.

Wait yes! So the potential simplifies to:

V = 2k x² + (k / 2) y².

Wow, that's a simplification. Because in 2D Cartesian coordinates, the potential is quadratic in x² and y². So this looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in x and y directions.

So, our system becomes an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, with oscillator frequencies in x and y given by the coefficients of x² and y². Hmm, because each terms would typically look like (mω² x²)/(2), but let's calculate.

The standard harmonic oscillator potential is V(x,y) = (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y².

Wait actually, in this case, V is expressed as 2k x² + (k/2) y². The factors in front here can be set equal to the standard expressions.

Let me write this as V = (2k) x² + (k/2) y².

So comparing to the standard harmonic potential (1/2 m ω²) x²,...

Wait, I think the potential can be rewritten to find the effective frequencies for each direction.

Each term for the harmonic oscillator is of the form (1/2) m ω^2 x^2, so let me express the given terms accordingly.

For the x-direction: (2k) x² = (1/2) m ω_x^2 x^2 → (2k) = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x^2 = (2k ) * 2 /m → Actually, wait:

Wait, harmonic oscillator potential is (m ω² x²)/2, right? So our term is 2k x². So,

2k x² = (m ω_x² x²) / 2 → 2k= (m ω_x^2)/2 → m ω_x^2 =4k → ω_x^2 =4k/m → ω_x = 2 √(k/m)

Similarly for y-direction, the term is (k/2 ) y² = (m ω_y^2 y²)/2 → k/2 = (m ω_y^2 )/2 → m ω_y^2 = k → ω_y^2 = k/m → ω_y=√(k/m).

So the x direction has a frequency ω_x =2 ω, and y direction frequency ω_y = ω, where ω is sqrt(k/m).

Wait, so in the system, each dimension is a harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies. The quantum harmonic oscillator in each direction has energy levels given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where n is the quantum number (n_x, n_y, etc.)

So each direction contributes an (n + 1/2) times ħω.

But wait, we have different ω in x and y. For x: frequency is 2ω, since sqrt(k/m)= ω, so 2ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m) ⇒ ω_x=2 sqrt(k/m) =2ω / wait the original was sqrt(k/m)=ω;

No! Let me rephrase: because for standard HO,

ω = sqrt(k/m).

Wait in the x-direction, our previous calculation: ω_x is 2*sqrt(k/m). Because,

Earlier, V_x = 2k x².

The standard HO equation we have is (1/2) m ω^2 x^2. So equate:

2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x^2 x² → 2k = (1/2) m ω_x^2 → m ω_x² =4k → ω_x= 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for y, the potential is (k/2 ) y².

Setting (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → canceling gives k/2 = 1/2 m ω_y^2 → m ω_y^2= k → ω_y= sqrt(k/m).

So, each direction has different effective frequencies: in x, ω_x=2 sqrt(k/m)= 2ω where ω=√(k/m).

The energy for each direction would be E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x,

And E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

But wait, the potential in the problem is quadratic, implying that the energy spectrum would be E = E_x + E_y = [n_x + 1/2 ] ħ ω_x + [n_y +1/2] ħ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x +1/2) ħ (2ω) + (n_y +1/2) ħ (ω)

Breaking that down:

E = [ 2 (n_x +1/2) ) ] ħ ω + [ (n_y +1/2) ] ħ ω.

Simplify:

2(n_x +½) = 2n_x +1

So,

E = (2n_x +1) ħ ω + (n_y + ½) ħ ω.

Combine the terms:

E = [ (2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 ) ] ħ ω.

Wait, no:

Wait, 2(n_x+1/2) = 2n_x +1,

and (n_y+1/2) remains.

Add: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2s => 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So,

E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ ω.

But since ω = sqrt(k/m), this becomes E = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2] ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait that matches one of the options. Looking at options:

Option C says E=(2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Yes.

So the correct energy spectrum is option C.

To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \(m\) moving in the two-dimensional potential \(V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta)\), we analyze the potential and simplify it as follows:

1. **Rewriting the Potential**:  
   Using the trigonometric identity \(\cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}\), the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
   \]

2. **Separation into Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   By expressing \(\cos(2\theta)\) in terms of Cartesian coordinates (\(x = r\cos\theta\), \(y = r\sin\theta\)), we find:
   \[
   \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2}.
   \]
   Substituting this back, the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{k}{2}y^2.
   \]
   This shows that the potential describes an **anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator**, with different frequencies in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions.

3. **Effective Frequencies**:  
   Comparing the potential \(V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{k}{2}y^2\) to the standard harmonic oscillator potential \(\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 r^2\), we determine the effective frequencies:
   - For the \(x\)-direction: \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\),
   - For the \(y\)-direction: \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

4. **Energy Spectrum**:  
   The energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:
   \[
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
   \]
   where \(n\) is the quantum number. For the \(x\)-direction, the energy is:
   \[
   E_x = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\omega,
   \]
   and for the \(y\)-direction, the energy is:
   \[
   E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega.
   \]
   Adding these contributions, the total energy is:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
   \]
   where \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

5. **Matching the Options**:  
   Substituting \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy spectrum becomes:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   This matches **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
