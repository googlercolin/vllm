Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me see...

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. Wait, no, more accurately, it's written as Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh right, because pion decays usually involve the pion splitting into a lepton and a neutrino. Remembering that pions can positively and negatively charged too.

The setup specifies that the Pi(+) is stationary. So it's an at-rest decay, which means the total momentum before must be zero because the pion isn't moving. The problem gives me the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, I guess neutrinos have a negligible mass. Or maybe it's a muon neutrino, and since it's a plus, perhaps it's a neutrino [mu+ needs a positron neutrino, but in the decay connection, it depends... but for energy calculations, the neutrino's mass is approximately zero, so it's like it's massless.]

Wait, okay, but in beta decay, the masses are dealt with using energy and momentum conservation. But let's get into the question.

The question is to find the kinetic energy of each of the product particles. That is, the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino. 

So, the setup: Pi(+) is at rest. It decays into a muon and a neutrino. Let's denote them as mu and nu.

Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, momentum of mu is +p, and neutrino is -p.

But conservation of energy as well. The total energy before is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c^4 = (139.6 MeV).

After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of muon and neutrino, plus the kinetic energies, although wait, actually the energy is the sum of their rest mass energies and their kinetic energies.

Wait, more accurately: Energy conservation says E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

And E_nu is just p_nu c, since neutrino's rest mass can be approximated as zero. Also, since their momenta are equal and opposite, their magnitudes are the same: p_mu = p_nu = p.

Hmm.

So, with that in mind, let's set up the equations.

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

E_pi = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) 

E_nu = p c 

So, the energies add to m_pi c^2.

So let's write these equations:

139.6 = sqrt( p²c⁴ + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Wait, since c=1 in these units typically (MeV and such, c is set to 1), so the equation simplifies to:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7^2) + p.

Wait, but units are in MeV as energy, since the masses are given in MeV/c². Wait, actually, when c is taken as 1 in units where E is Mc², we can ignore c here. Hmm, maybe not, maybe confusion arises. Let's think in terms where c=1. So m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu =105.7 MeV. 

So E_pi = 139.6, E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2), E_nu = p.

Because E_nu would be p*c, but since c=1, just p. But wait, energy from neutrino is p*c. Hmm, I think your approach is correct when considering energy in terms of (MeV) but units are such that c=1. Let's proceed.

So let me restate:

E_pi = 139.6 MeV.
E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )
E_nu = p 

And from conservation:

E_mu + E_nu = E_pi.

So,

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2 ) + p = 139.6.

This is the equation to solve for p.

Let me denote this as:

sqrt(p^2 + a^2) + p = B,

where a = 105.7, B=139.6.

Let me isolate the square root to solve for p.

sqrt(p² + a²) = (B - p).

Square both sides,

p² + a² = (B - p)^2.

Expanding right side: B² - 2Bp + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

a² = B² - 2B p.

Then,

2 B p = B² - a².

So,

p = (B² - a²)/(2 B).

Compute this value.

Now, plug in the values:

a =105.7, B =139.6.

Compute B²: 139.6^2.

Let me compute each part.

Compute a², which is 105.7^2: 105.7 *105.7.

Wait, 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140.

So a^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49= 10000+1140 is 11140, plus 32.49 is11172.49.

Similarly, B^2= (139.6)^2.

Well,

139.6 is (140 - 0.4), so (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2= 19600 - 112 + 0.16= 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16, so 19488.16.

So,

B^2 -a^2 = 19488.16 -11172.49 = let's compute that.

Subtract:

19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19,488.16 -11,172.49 = 8,315.67?

Wait, 19,488.16 minus 11,172.49.

19,488.16 minus 11,172 is 8316.16. Then minus 0.49: 8316.16 -0.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then,

p= (8315.67) / ( 2 *139.6 )

So denominator = 279.2.

So, 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Divide roughly, 279.2 = approximately 279, 8315.67 / ~279.

Divide 8315.67 by 279:

279 * 29 = 279 *30 is 8370, which is a bit higher than 8315. Let's see: 279 * 29 = 8091, and 8091 plus 279 is 8370. So 8370 is about 29. So my 8315 is a bit less.

Alternatively, we can do this:

279 x 29.6 = approx 29.6 * 279 = 29 * 279 =8091 + 0.6*279=167.4 → total 8091+167.4=8258.4. Hmm, which is less than 8315.67.

Next, 279 x 29.8 = 279*(29.6 +0.2)= 29.6 gives 8258.4 + (279*.2)=55.8 → total 8258.4+55.8=8314.2. Hmm, very close to 8315.67.

So p ≈ 29.8 MeV/c? Wait, so 279.2 * 29.8 would be about 8315.67? Let me compute 279.2 *29.8.

Calculating 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → then subtract 279.2 *0.2 → which is 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. Hmm, but our numerator was 8315.67. So perhaps figure around 29.8.

Wait, but let me compute in a more precise way.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 

= 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me calculate 8315.67 / 279.2:

Divide numerator and denominator by, say, approximately 3.

279.2 ≈ 280. So 8315.67 ÷ 280 ≈ 29.7 (since 280*30=8400. So 8315 is 85 below → ≈ (8400-85)/280= 29.67 MeV/c).

So p ≈ about 29.8 MeV/c? Maybe 29.76... Actually, if the exact value is closer. So let's proceed.

But perhaps rather than approximate, I should calculate time. Alternatively, perhaps proceed with calculation, and correct any mistakes later.

Okay, so take approximate p≈29.76. So E_nu = p ≈29.76 MeV ?

Wait, that's the neutrino's energy.

Wait wait, no: the neutrino’s energy is p. Because E_nu = p*c; and if we took c=1, then 29.76. Yes.

But let's compute this more accurately. Let's say precise p.

Alternatively, using the exact formula:

p= (139.6^2 -105.7^2)/(2*139.6) 

Let me compute that. 

Compute (139.6)^2 =19488.16 (as before). 105.7^2=11172.49.

So B² - a² =19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67; OK.

Denominator is 2 *139.6=279.2. 

8315.67 /279.2 is the same as 831567 / 2792.

Let me compute 83156.7 ÷2792.

Wait, let's do it as:

8315.67 /279.2 = ?

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

≈ 29.76... Since 279.2 *29.76 = appr 8315.

But let's do it step by step.

279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

279.2* 29.7= 279.2 *29 +279.2*0.7=8096.8 +195.44 = 8292.24.

279.2*0.06 =16.752.

So 279.2 *29.76=8292.24 +16.752 =8308.992. That is close to 8315.67.

Hmm the target is 8315.67.

The current amount is 8308.992 after 29.76. So difference is 6.678.

Since each 0.01 of p gives 2.792 of product.

So 6.678 ÷ ( 2.792 ∼ per 0.01 ) → 6.678 /2.792≈ 2.38.

So in terms of 29.76+ 0.0238 → 29.7838.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu =p≈29.78 MeV.

The total p for mu: same magnitude but opposite direction -> mu momentum is say -29.78.

Wait, but not, the actual setup is that the magnitudes are same, but directions are opposite. So mu's magnitude is p=29.78, and neutrino's p is same. So for kinetic energy, each would have KE.

Wait, the question has to find the kinetic energies of mu and nu.

Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

So KE of mu:

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) → which is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Wait, wait. Because mu's rest mass is 105.7, so KE for mu is that.

We can compute E_mu thusally.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2: approx 29.78*29.78.

About 29^2 is 841. (29)^2 is841, 0.78^2≈0.6084. The cross term is 2*29 *0.78= 44.04. So 29.78^2 ≈ (29 +0.78)^2= 29^2 + 2*29 *0.78 + (0.78)^2 =841 +44.04 + 0.6084≈ 841+44.04 is 885.04+0.6084=885.6484. Let me compute 29.78^2 = (30-0.22)^2=30² -2*30*0.22 +0.22^2 =900 -13.2+0.0484 = 900-13.2=886.8 +0.0484=886.8484. Hmm, but actual 29.78^2 can be computed as:

29*29 =841.

.78 *29  *2 when you distribute (a +b)^2= a² +2ab + b².

Wait no, perhaps better to just compute 29.78 * 29.78.

Tough without a calculator, but approx 29.78 is about 29.78^2 ≈ 887 perhaps. But let's use the precise approach numerically.

But let's compute separately:

105.7 squared is 11172.49 (earlier calculation).

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → sqrt(885.6484 + 11172.49) = sqrt( 12058.1384 ) ≈ Let's take sqrt(12058).

Well, sqrt(12058)= approximately since 110^2 =12 100. So sqrt(12,058)=109.36 (because 109^2=11881, 109.36^2= (109 +0.36)^2= 109^2 + 2*109*0.36 +0.36^2.

109^2=11881, 2*109*0.36= (218)*0.36= 78.48; .36^2=0.1296; So 109.36²=11881 +78.48=11959.48 +0.1296≈11959.61. But wait, the accurate 109.36²? Hmm, wait actually another way, perhaps: 109^2 is 11881, so 109.36²= 109^2 + 2*109 *0.36 + (0.36)^2 → 11881 + 78.48 (approx) + 0.1296≈11881 +78.61= 11959.61.

Wait our 12058 is higher than 11959.61 Looking for a number whose square is 12058. So let's try 109.8:

Compute 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2=109² + 2*109*.8 +.8^2=11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 11881+174.4=12055.4 +0.64=12056.04. Close to 12058 desired.

What's approximately 109.8² =12056.04 → our E_mu is sqrt(12058.14) ≈ 109.8 or 109.8 approximately. Let's compute.

Actually, 109.8 squared is 12056.04. The target is 12058. So delta is ~2. The difference is (12058 -12056.04)= 1.96. To approximate higher, so 109.8 + delta such that (109.8 +delta)^2 ≈ 12058.

Using the binomial approximation: (a + delta)^2 ≈ a^2 + 2 a delta.

So,

a =109.8,

a² =12056.04,

target: 12058.

delta: (12058 -12056.04 )/(2*a) = (1.96)/(2*109.8)=1.96/(219.6)= approx 0.0089.

So delta is about 0.0089; thus a+delta ≈109.8 +0.0089 =109.8089, respectively 109.81 (approx).

So E_mu≈109.81 MeV.

So total energy:

E_mu=109.81, E_nu=29.78. Sum: 109.81 +29.78=139.59,close to 139.6, so it works.

Now, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass.

So, kinetic energy for mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2.

Since m_mu is 105.7, E_mu is 109.81.

So mu's KE=109.81 - 105.7=4.11 MeV roughly.

Similarly, neutrino's KE is their total energy (p*c, same as E_nu , which is p≈29.78) minus its rest mass. But wait, neutrino's rest mass is zero, so KE= E_nu.

So neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

So the product KE would be ~4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

But in the options, that's not exactly present. Let's check the options.

Option A: 2.84 MeV, 26.8, no, not near.

Option B:7.2,32.8 → as well, way above.

Option C:3.52, 20.8 → too low.

Option D:4.12,29.8 → wow, very close to my calculation.

Yes, the muon has KE≈4.11 (Option D says 4.12, which is spot on given rounding), and neutrino is 29.8 MeV. So option D seems correct.

Hence, the correct choice is D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and ν.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. By conservation of momentum, the μ⁺ and ν must have equal and opposite momenta, i.e., \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \). 

Conservation of energy gives:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu},
\]
where \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) (since the pion is stationary), \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \), and \( E_{\nu} = p \). Substituting \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), we get:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Isolating the square root term:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2(139.6)}.
\]
Compute \( (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \), \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \), and:
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the μ⁺
The total energy of the μ⁺ is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Compute \( (29.78)^2 \approx 887.0 \), \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \), so:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the μ⁺
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum, \( E_{\nu} = p \). Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A:** \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option B:** \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option C:** \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option D:** \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
