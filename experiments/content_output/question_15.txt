Question: Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.


Assistant Response:

Okay, so we've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They're both detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives info on their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is shorter. Specifically, it's three times shorter than Planet_2's.

Also, their orbits are circular, so we don't have to worry about eccentricity messing things up. The host stars have the same radii, but the star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so we need to figure out which factors influence transit probability.

Hmm, transit probability depends on the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The primary factor determining this is the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. But wait, actually, the probability of a transit is higher when the planet is more likely to lie in the plane of our view.

I remember that the transit probability P is approximated by the formula P ≈ (R_star / a)^2, where R_star is the radius of the star and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, isn't that more about the depth of the transit? Let's think again. The probability that a randomly inclined orbit causes a transit is given by R/(a), approximately. Because the disk of the star, whose radius is R, must align with our line of sight for the planet (at distance a) to block it.

Oh yes, the probability that a planet transits is (R_star / a_planet), assuming that all orbital inclinations are random. Because the planet must cross the line of sight within the cone of the star's disk. The probability decreases as a increases because you're more likely out of view.

Wait, but wait another formula might be R_star/(a) because the geometry is such that the chord has to be larger than the star's diameter? Hmm, I'm a bit confused between the different ways to calculate this.

Wait, let me look this up in my mind. The transit probability is given by P = (R_*/a) × (some function depending on other parameters), but I think if the orbit is randomly oriented, the probability is (R_*) / (a * sqrt(eccentricity^2 + (1/(b))^2))), but wait here, the orbits are circular so e=0, and it simplifies.

Or wait, alternative approach: In circular orbits, the probability is given by (R_star / a). No, more accurately, it's roughly (R_star / a), but scaled because it's the impact parameter. Alternatively, (2 R_*)/(a sqrt(b^2 + R_*^2)), but perhaps that's getting into too mathy details.

Wait, really, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the formula to remember is that the probability that a planet transits its star is P ≈ (R_* / a) × (something else?), but considering that, when a is larger, the transit probability is lower.

Wait, with a being the semi-major axis. Since we have two stars with the same radius R, since R is the same for both stars, Planet_1's probability is better when a is smaller.

Because R is same but a might be different. Let's compute a for each planet.

Wait, but wait, no, we know the masses of the stars. Planet_1's star has mass M1 which is twice that of the host star's mass of Planet_2, which is M2 = M1/2.

We can find the semi-major axis from Kepler's law. Kepler's third law for planets: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M + m)) / (4 pi^2), but since the planet's mass is much less than the star, we can approximate (M + m) ≈ M.

So, a ≈ ( (G M P^2) / (4 pi²) )^1/3, but in our case, we can compare a_1 and a_2.

We have P_1 = P_2 / 3 because it's three times shorter. Also, M1 = 2 M2.

Let's write the a for each:

a_1 is for Planet_1: a_1^3 = (G M1 (P_1)^2) / (4 pi² )

Similarly, a_2^3 = (G M2 (P_2)^2) / (4 pi² )

Dividing the two: a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (M1 P_1²) / ( M2 P_2² )

M1 = 2 M2,

P_1 = (1/3) P_2,

Plug those in:

a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (2 M2) * ( ( (1/3) P_2 ) )^2 ) / ( M2 P_2^2 )

Simplify numerator inside: (2) * ( (1/9 P_2^2 ) )

Denominator: M2,P2².

So a_1^3 / a_2^3 = [ 2 * (P_2^2/9) ) * M2 ] / [ M2 P_2^2 ]
Wait better substitute directly:

M1 / M2 = (2 M2) / M2 )= 2,

P_1^2 = ( (1/3) P_2 )^2 = (P_2²) / 9.

So,

(M1 * P_1² ) / ( M2 * P_2² ) ) = [2 * (1/9 P2²) ) ] / [ (M2 ) P2² ]  Wait. Ah, no, substitution after divided as a1^3 /a2^3 = ( M1 * P1² ) / ( M2 * P2² )

Which is:

(2 M2) * ( (P2/3 )^2 ) ) / ( M2 * P2^2 )

So M2 cancels, leaving 2 * (P2² /9 ) ) / ( P2² ) )
= (2 ( P2² ) ) / (9 * P2² ) ) 
= 2/9.

So,

a_1^3 / a_2^3 = 2/9
Take cube roots:

a_1 / a_2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ cube root of 0.222.

Calculate that: So 0.222 = approx (0.6 )^3 because 0.6 *0.6=0.36, 0.36*0.6=0.216. Close. So a_1 = a_2 * 0.6 (approx).

So a_1 ≈ 0.6 a_2.

But knowing the exact relation might better. Let me calculate 2/9:

cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08, so (2/9)^(1/3) is approximately (0.2222)^1/3 ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 ≈ 0.606 a_2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is (R_* / a) for their respective a.

But since both host stars have the same radius R = R1 = R2 (because the host of Planet_1 has twice the star mass, but the other is slightly evolved and same radius as Planet_2's host)—so R1 = R2.

So probability_proportional_Planet_1 = R / a_1,

Planet_2: R/a_2.

So P1 / P2 = ( R/a1 ) / ( R/a2 ) ) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2 / a1 = approximately 1.65.

So the ratio P1/P2 is approx 1.65, meaning P1 is higher.

Wait a second, for transit probability, you're comparing P1 and P2. So if P1 is R / a1, and P2 is R / a2, and a1 < a2 (a_1 is smaller), than R/a1 is bigger than R/a2.. So P1 > P2, with P1 being approximately ( a2 /a1 ) times P2.

Ah, but wait, a2 = a_2 = Kepler's third law scales with star mass and period. Let's compute their a's more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute a_1 and a_2 numerically, maybe with some approximation.

Let me choose some numbers for easier calculation. Suppose P_2 is in years, M2 in solar masses.

But perhaps we can take M2 as 1 solar mass (so M1 is 2), P2 as 3 units (so P_1 is 1 unit). Let's plug into Kepler's law.

But let's instead use the formula to find the ratio more accurately.

Kepler's third law formula:

a^3 = (G(M + m) * P^2) / (4 pi^2)

Assuming m << M, a^3 ∝ M * P^2

So, (a1/a2)^3 = [ (M1 * P1^2 ) / ( M2 * P2^2 ) ]

As before, M1=2*M2, P1 = P2 /3.

Thus,

(a1)^3 / (a2)^3 = [ (2 M2) P1^2 ] / [ M2 P2^2 ]

= [ 2 * ( (P2/3 )^2 ) ] / [ P2^2 ]

= [ 2 * ( P2² / 9 ) ] / [ P2² ]

= 2/(9) ≈ 0.2222.

So a1/a2 = cube_root(0.2222) ≈ 0.6 (as before).

So a1 = 0.6 a_2. So a ratios are like a1:a2 = 0.6 : 1.

For transit probability, P is (R_star / a). Since R is same for both, which ratio is (R / a1) vs (R/a2).

So P_planet_1 = R / (0.6 * a2 ), which helps because R is same.

So P_planet_1 = (R) / (0.6 a_2 )

P_planet_2 = R / a_2.

So P_planet_1 / P_planet_2 = [ (R/(0.6 a2)) ] / (R/a2 ) ) = 1 /0.6 = 1.666..., so about 1.666 times as likely.

So P_planet_1 is higher.

Wait, that would say Planet_1 has about 1.666 times (5/3) higher probability.

But wait, but the options are given in ratios. Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D says ~2.7 times higher.

So if it's 1.65 times, that's closer to 1.666, which is 5/3 (~1.666).

So probably the probability is higher for Planet_1, option C or maybe D? Oh wait, which is a 1.65 factor, which would match.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option C)1.65 times higher.

So the option we'd go with would be that Planet_1 has a higher probability, so choose either C or D. But according to our calculation, it's around 1.666, which the option calls 1.65.

But another possibility: is transit probability (R/a) (since P ≈ R/a), so the larger P (probability) is when a is small, R is the same for both.

Wait, just another point. Are there other factors contributing to the probability?

Wait, the formula I remember for transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is usually (R_* + R_p)/(a), where R_p is planet radius. But in this case, R_p is the same for both because both are Earth-like, so that would be the same as (R_* / a), as R_p is a constant.

So yeah, the impact is just (R_star /a). So P_planet is proportional to R/a.

Since R is same for both, since R1=R2.

Thus, the only variable is a. a is smaller for Planet_1.

Hence, a1 ≈ 0.6a_2.

Thus transit probability is higher for Planet_1, with ratio P_1: P_2 = (R/a1):(R/a2) = a2 : a1 = (1)/(0.6) → approx 1.666.

Thus overall, Planet_1's P is 1.666 times that of Planet_2. So which option is that.

Looking back options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ≈1.65 times.

Option D: 2.7 times.

Hmmm, perhaps we made a mistake in considering if the probability is (R/a) or whether we should square it.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think about the transit geometry again.

In the edge-on case, the planet passes directly in front. The probability is determined by the ratio of the area where the planet can cause a transit relative to the possible orbital angles. The planet must lie in a certain cone relative to the star.

The exact formula for the transit probability when considering inclination is P = (R_*/a) / (1 - (R_*/a)^2 )^(1/2), but when R_* is much smaller than a, which is usually the case for planets, this reduces to approximately R_*/a.

Wait, perhaps the exact formula.

Wait, more accurate transit probability is given by:

Probability, P ≈ (R_*/(a (1 - e²)))^(1/2) × (1 + ... ), but in our case, e=0 and all else is negligible, so P≈ R*/(a).

Alternatively, the correct formula is 2 R_*/(a sqrt(1-e²}} ) ), which for e=0 becomes 2 R_*/a.

Wait. That complicates things. Did I get that right?

Wait, let me look up (in my mind): The transit probability for a randomly oriented, circular orbit is P≈ 2 (R_*/a ). Wait, because the planet needs to have an inclination within an angle of R_* / a. The solid angle involved is 2R_* /a when in radians, so P = 2 (R*/a) * (1/ (sqrt( (a)^2 - (R_*)^2 )) )) / ???.

Alternatively, I'll have to think in terms of the star's disk as seen from Earth. Let me imagine this: the planet's path around the star is a circle of radius a. From Earth's perspective, the probability that any given point along the planet's orbit lies across the star is the area of the target (the star's disk) divided by the area of the circle (distance a^2), but for geometry, it's more about the ratio of the radii.

Wait, wait, maybe another approach: The probability that the planet transits is the fraction of its orbit that is within the ring that would cause a transit.

But since the orbits are edge-on, transit occurs when the planet is in the plane of our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the spherical probability would be such that the plane would need to be within a certain angle θ, where θ = asin(R*/a) ), given for edge-on case.

The volume of possible inclinations that allow transit is 2θ/(2*90°) ) [since θ could be above and below the plane]. So Probability P= 2 θ / 180° = (2 * θ)/ (pi/2), because θ is in radians.

Wait, no. Let's correct ourselves: The inclination is measured from the pole-on view; if it is exactly edge-on, i=90 degrees, and transits occur. Only an i within a certain range would cause transits. The range is from i values that allow the planet to pass in front.

So for a given a and R, the minimum allowable inclination sin(i) ≥ R*/a. Because that's the condition when the planet's orbit passes in front of the star.

So the inclination angles for which sin(i) ≥ R*/a are acceptable. The probability would be the measure of all acceptable i divided by the range of possible i values.

The acceptable i range is from isin_i = R*/a to 90 degrees.

The total possible i is 0 to 180, but for highly inclined orbits, only those with sin(i) higher than R*/a will cause transits.

Wait, the volume for allowable i is from i = arcsin (R*/a) to 90 degrees and also from 90 to 180 degrees because sin(180 -i)=sin i. So we'd need to consider this.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact probability calculation. Let me think in terms of probability distribution.

The probability is essentially the measure of all possible inclinations for which the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth) transits.

In spherical coordinates, the probability is approx (2 R_*/ a ) / (1 )

Ah, that's right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the probability, P = [ ( R*/a ) * 2 ] / some factor.

Hold on, perhaps from the transit probability derivation:

The allowed inclinations are those where the argument of the perihelion (ω) has certain positions, but with the given that e=0, it's just the inclination.

The area of the sphere subtended by the transit condition: the planet's orbital plane lies such that any inclination where sin(i) ≥ R*/a will yield a transit. So the fraction of the sphere in which sin(i) ≥ R*/a is the probability.

But how much is that fraction?

The area is proportional to the solid angle. The possible sin(i) must be >= R*/a ⇒ i ≥ arcsin(R*/a).

The area contributes over the surface of a sphere. Surface area as a function of inclination angle i (measured from the pole); the circles at a given inclination are rings with area 2 π r sin(i) dr. Wait, no. But perhaps it's better to look at the fraction.

The fraction of positions allowing transit is [ 2 π (1 - cos(arcsin( R*/a ) )) ] / (4 π).

Because 4 pi is the total solid angle, and the favorable region (where transits occur) is from i=arcsin(R*/a) to pi/2 (because sin(pi - i) = sin i, symmetrical). So the favorable area is a spherical cap's area.

The area of the cap is 2 pi (1 - cos(theta)), where theta is the angular radius of the cap.

In our case, theta = arcsin(R*/a), since the condition is sin(theta) = R*/a.

Wait, so for a possible inclination θ, the planet transits when it lies within ±θ from our line of sight. The probability then is the ratio of the spherical cap's area (where it's within the required inclination) to the total area.

Wait, the minimum theta is such that sin(theta) = R*/a, so theta = arcsin(R*/a).

Then the area of the cap is 2 pi (1 - cos theta) ), so the total favorable area is double that, because the planet could be on either side (upper or lower hemisphere), so multiplying by 2. But since we're already considering the spherical cap on one side as 2 pi (1 - cos(theta)), but we have to account for both sides since i can be between 0 and pi, but the planet would transit if the inclination is either more than 90 degrees minus theta or less than 90 degrees plus theta?

Wait, perhaps better viewed this way: the minimum inclination is when the planet's orbital plane is at sin(i) >= R*/a. So the measure of i is [i1= arcsin(R*/a) to i2= pi - arcsin(R*/a)], but integrating over the hemisphere i from 0 to 180 degrees, this favorable region occurs between i = (arcsin (R*/a)) and (pi - arcsin (R*/a)).

So the portion of the probability is the measure of the favorable i values over the possible i (which covers 0 to pi.

Let me model this differently. The solid angle for favorable i is the proportion of the total sphere where sin(i) >= R*/a. The total solid angle is 4 pi steradians. The acceptable range is i from i_start to i_end, which is: i_start = i1= arcsin(R*/a), i_end = i2 = pi - i1.

The surface area element in spherical coordinates is 2 pi sin(i) di * dphi. But for each i, phi ranges from 0 to 2 pi. So the integral for the favorable area is ∫ (from i= i_start to i = pi - i_start) ∫ phi 0 to 2pi) sin(i) dphi di.

Which is ∫ (from i_start to pi - i_start ) (2 pi sin(i) ) di.

So compute this integral.

The integral of sin i di from i_start to pi - i_start.

Let me make substitution: let x = i_start, then integral is from x to pi – x:

∫ sin x dx from x to pi –x is ∫ sin x dx from x to pi –x.

Wait, integral of sin x is – cos x. Evaluated from x to pi – x:

[ -cos(pi – x) + cos x ].

But cos(pi – x) = -cos(x), so substituting:

-(-cos x) + cos x = cos x + cos x = 2 cos x.

So the integral becomes 2 pi * ( 2 cos (i_start) )

But i_start = arcsin(R*/a), so cos (i_start ) = sqrt( 1 – (R*/a )^2 )

Thus, the favorable solid angle:

2 pi * [ 2 sqrt( 1 – (R_*/a )^2 ) ] = 4 pi sqrt( 1 – ( R_*/ a )^2 )

But wait, no, that can't be, because the total was 4 pi, but observed solid angle is 4 pi sqrt(1 - ( R*/a )^2 ), implying probability P is [4 pi sqrt(....) ]/(4 pi ), else that's not possible.

Wait no: the favorable area would be 4 pi ( sqrt(1– (R*/a)^2 ) ), but this can't be more than 4 pi, so perhaps made an error.

Wait, let me start over again.

Compute the area for favorable i: A = 2 pi ∫ (from i_start to i_end) sin(i) di.

i_end = pi –i_start.

Thus,

A = 2 pi [ -cos(i) ] evaluated from i_start to (pi – i_start )

= 2 pi [ ( - cos(pi – i_start ) ) + cos(i_start) ) ]

cos(pi – i_start ) = - cos(i_start ), 

so,

=> 2 pi [ ( - (- cos(i_start) ) + cos(i_start) ) ] 

= 2 pi [ cos(i_start ) + cos(i_start ) ]

= 2 pi * 2 cos(i_start )

=4 pi cos(i_start )

The total solid angle is 4 pi. So the probability is A / (4 pi )

= [4 pi cos(i_start ) ] / (4 pi ) = cos (i_start )

But i_start is arcsin (R*/a ), so cos(i_start ) = sqrt( 1 – (R*/a )^2 )

So finally, probability P = sqrt( 1 – ( R*/a )^2 ) } 

Whoa, that's a different outcome.

Hmm, thus, P =√[1 – (R*/a )^2 ]

Wait, but that doesn't make sense for the planet to have higher probability when a is smaller.

Because with lower a, R/a is bigger, so P decreases. But that would imply that closer planets actually have a lower probability. That wouldn't make sense. Because in reality, closer in planets have smaller a and hence higher probability of transiting.

Wait, no, wait; your formula may have an error, because if you're at a smaller a, R*/a is larger, so (R*/a )^2 approaches 1, and 1- something near 1 is small. So P approaches 0?

That can't be right, because in case R*/a is very large (impossible since a must be larger than R* to have planets), but when a is just a little larger than R*, we get sqrt(1 – x), where x is (R*/a)^2 which approaches 1 as a approaches R*.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the inclination logic wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct probability formula is P = ( R_*/a ) } or something else.

It's getting too complicated, but I think my initial approach that P is proportional to R* / a is correct for approximation, given that, with P_1 higher.

Wait, for the cases given a is smaller, P is higher is correct.

But according to what we thought before, the correct answer is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But in our initial calculation using a_1 = 0.6 a_2, and with P being proportional to 1/a, which would make P_1 larger than P_2. Therefore, Planet_1's P is higher.

But now that our calculation using the spherical cap gives P = sqrt(1 – (R*/a )^2 ), that would result in higher a giving higher transit probability, which would suggest lower for Planet_1. Which is contradictory to the previous assertion.

Wait but according to that, if a is larger,  R*/a is smaller, so the probability is sqrt(1 – (something small) ), which is about 1.

But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps another way: For an Earth-like planet around a star, the transit probability is ~ R*/a, but only when a is much larger than R*. Given that for small a, R*/a is bigger, and thus transit probability increases.

Wait, considering that in practice.

The Kepler mission, for example, which observes many small stars with close-in planets knows best. The closer a planet is to its star, the higher the probability of transiting. Wait, why? Because if a planet is very close (small a), there are more possible lines of sight where it would transit.

Alternatively, no? Thinking about a planet very far (large a): the chance of it passing in front becomes lower.

Ah, so for a given star and planet, P ≈ R*/a, which aligns with the initial assumption because if a is much smaller, R*/a is higher, so P higher.

So the disparity is apparent. Because in formula derivations, the spherical cap approach leads to a different result, but maybe I messed up the logic.

Alternatively, I might have to assume that the approximated probability is (R/a), so with a1=0.6 a2, rating P1/P2 as 1/(0.6)=1.666 or 5/3, so higher P for Planet_1.

So, given the problem and our initial conclusion, then the answer must be that Planet_1 is observed because it has higher transit probability.

Looking back at options, option C is "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability." Since our approximate calculation gave 1.666, and our options have 1.65 times, which is close considering I approximated cube root of 2/9 as 0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the a ratio is a1 is cube_root of (2/9) times a2 numerically.

Compute 2/9 = 0., cube root is approximately 0.606.

So perhaps the exact ratio is 1 / cube_root(2/9).

Wait, wait, the exact transit probability depends on (R/ a ), since R is same for both stars, so P1/P2 = a2 /a1.

So because a1 is smaller, the so inexact fractions of around 1.65 (since 0.6's reciprocal is 1.666), which is option C, so the answer is option C.

But wait, the initial computations of option C is Planet_1 is preferred because it's 1.65 times higher. Therefore, correct answer is C.
</think>

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. For a randomly oriented circular orbit, the transit probability is approximated as:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_*}{a}
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\( a \)) of the planet's orbit.

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio (\( a_1 / a_2 \))
Using Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M \cdot P^2
\]

where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \)
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio (\( P_1 / P_2 \))
Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), we have:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}}} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not ~1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the transit probability ratio is ~1.65.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not ~2.7.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2 due to its smaller orbital period and the properties of its host star. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

**Answer: C**
