Question: Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.


Assistant Response:
To determine which planet is more likely to transit, we need to consider the transit probability, which is influenced by the orbital period and the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. However, since the radii of both host stars are the same and the mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star housing Planet_2, and both stars are on circular orbits, the key factor here is the orbital period.

The transit probability is generally proportional to the fraction of the orbit where the planet is within the observer's line of sight, which is influenced by the orbital period. For a circular orbit, the probability of transit is approximately the same for any planet orbiting a star with the same radius, but the shorter the orbital period, the more frequent the transits over a given time, which generally means a higher probability of being observed during a specific observing period, assuming the observing time is limited.

Given that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2, Planet_1 will transit more frequently, making it more likely to be detected during the limited observing time. The specific factors mentioned (mass ratio of the stars and radius ratio being the same) affect the transit depth but not the transit probability in this context.

To quantify the probability, we can use the formula for transit probability but the key insight is the orbital period difference. The probability is linked to the inverse of the orbital period, so Planet_1, with a shorter period, has a higher transit probability.

Considering the options, the correct statement reflecting the higher probability of detection due to the shorter orbital period is:
