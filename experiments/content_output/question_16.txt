C) 2
D) 4

Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Optically active means the compound has chiral centers, so it can rotate plane-polarized light. Right, but wait, having a chiral center is necessary but not sufficient if the compound has a plane of symmetry or if it's a meso compound. Oh, right, because meso compounds have multiple chiral centers but are superimposable on their mirror images, so they aren't chiral.

Alright, let's look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Hmm. The structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, butene is CH2=CH. Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

It's 1-chloro, so Cl is on C1. Then the double bond is between C1 and C2, since it's but-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C#1=C#2-CH(CH3). Wait, no. Let me think again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The butene is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So positions are C1, C2, C3, C4. Structure: C1Cl=C(C2)(CH3)-C3-C4? Or more accurately, perhaps the structure is more like Cl–C(CH2CH2... Wait, no.

Wait, but structure as follows: 

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But here, in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the Cl is on the first carbon and a methyl on the second. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (but-1-ene). So structure is Cl-C(R) double bond C(CH3)-..., wait, perhaps it's Cl.C=C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-configuration. So the Cl is on C1, and the configuration is Z, which refers to how the substituents are arranged on each side of the double bond.

Wait, but the question is about optical activity. So for a molecule to be optically active, it should have a chiral center, right? But what about allenes or other geometries? Maybe not. So does this compound have stereogenic centers?

In 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: C1 is Cl, C2 is in a double bond, so the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but position 1 is C1: so it must be CH2Cl on C1? No, butene has double bond starting at C1, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1, so Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2.

So, structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, no, wait. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Chloro on C1 (CH2Cl), and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait that can't be right. Let me sketch the structure.

Carbon 1: connected to Cl and double bonded to C2.

Carbon 2: has a methyl group (CH3), and a double bond to C1, and maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it this way: the molecule has a double bond. A double bond with substituents on either end.

So at the double bond, C1 is Cl on one end, and perhaps a CH2 group? Wait, no.

Wait, let's write it as:

Cl 
|
C1=C2(CH3) - C3 - C4?

Wait, maybe more correctly: for (Z) configuration, the highest priority groups on each carbon (C1 and C2) would have the lower groups on the same side.

But to get back on track: What's the chirality? The molecule must have a chiral center.

In this case, is there a chiral center? The substituents on each carbon are... C1 has Cl and two other groups (since it's a double bond, it's sp² hybridized). So no, C1 can't be a chiral center because it's double bonded, preventing it from having four different substituents. Similarly, for double bonds, if they lead to a trigonal center, which can't support four different groups.

Wait, but can a double bond have a stereocenter? Or does the molecule have a stereocenter elsewhere? Wait, perhaps one of the adjacent carbons has a chiral center, but in this molecule, let's look.

C2: it's also double bonded, so if it's the center, it must have H as substituents? Alternatively, if C2 has a methyl, perhaps. So, looking at the substituents around C2: (looking down the chain), possible substituents are H, Cl from C1, CH3, and another CH2 group from C3, and perhaps another H? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck on this. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule is a diene or has some other arrangement. Maybe I should move on to the next compound and revisit.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's try to parse the structure. Heh, this is a bicyclic compound, probably. The main part is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Then, an 8-(chloromethylene) group attached, with E configuration.

Wait, the "methano" part implies a bridge between two atoms. So 4 and 7 have a methylene bridge making a bicyclic structure. So perhaps it's a fused ring structure, which is a Bicyclic[4.4.0] compound or something along those lines.

The substituents (R and S configurations) suggest there are chiral centers. Also, since it's an E configuration, the substituents on the double bond are opposite. The presence of multiple chiral centers might mean that the molecule is chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure if the ring system would have inherent symmetry. Hmm, maybe. Wait, the substituents are at 8? So the substituent is a chloromethylene group attached to the system. So perhaps, the bicyclic system has a bridge leading to a four-membered ring or similar. Since the 1,3-dione suggests ketone groups on positions 1 and 3. So there are two ketones nearby.

But perhaps the bridge itself introduces a chiral center. Given it has defined R and S configurations, the molecule is not symmetric, and thus is chiral, hence optically active. So this one would have optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when it's 2,3-dimethyl, each of those CH2 groups have a methyl substituent. So the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH.

Now, at C2, substituents: two CH3 (wait or just one CH3?), wait: (2R,3S) means that on the second carbon (which is C2 of succinic acid), the substituents are a CH3 group on the central carbons.

Wait succinic acid is a four-carbon chain with two COOH groups on each end. The structure should be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? Or perhaps at the 2 and 3 positions... No, I think that in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each internal carbon (which are the second and third carbons) have a methyl group.

So it's like:

HOOC-CH(CH3)   – CH(CH3) – COOH.

Wait, but each of these can have four substituent groups? So each CH(CH3) group in the central two carbon is:

At C2: two hydrogens (from CH2 in succinic acid) but with a methyl substitution. So whether each such C has R and S configurations.

The question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Looking at the structure: the molecule is a succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3, each. The configurations are R and S on those carbons, specifically (2R,3S).

Wait? So if each of those carbons has the substituents:

For C2: groups are (a) COOH (left), (b) CH3, (c) H, and (d) CH(CH3) (right?)?

Wait, the actual arrangement for each would be the carbonyl groups on each end of an internal two carbons, each being CH(CH3) groups in fact.

But each internal carbon (C2 and C3) is attached to:

At C2:

- Succinate group (from C1, which is the left COOH)
- CH(CH3)
- Another CH3?
Wait, structure as HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, in that case, each central C (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are: -COOH, -CH3 (from methyl group), and -CH(CH3)-... Wait, no, the central C2 would have:

Let me think visually.

Succinic acid (without the substituents) is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH.

When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, it becomes:

HOOC(CH2CH3), wait no—no, it's 2,3-dimethyl, so each of the CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3).

Wait, no. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. 2,3-dimethyl would replace each CH2 with CH(CH3). I think.

So the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH(CH3) carbon is C2 and C3.

So C2 has:

- COOH on one side and CH(CH3) on the other.

But a chiral center requires four different substituents. Let's see.

For C2, substituents:

a) -CH(CH3) (connected to C3)
b) -COOH (left)
c) -H
d) The two methyl groups? No, because it's CH(CH3), a single methyl? Wait no, the substituents for each chiral carbon would be: left is -COOH, right is something else. Wait:

Wait chemistrychef, let me think. Ok, the CH(CH3) on C2 would have:

- to the left: the succinate, connected via a single bond—no, actually, no.

Wait perhaps substituents are as follows for C2:

1. The connection to the left COOH group (as R1).
2. The CH2 group to its right (perhaps a CH because it's a 2,3?), no.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it, let's go step by step.

C2 is connected to four different substituents?

Group 1: COOH from C1.

Group 2: from C3: perhaps a CH(CH3), though if it's CH(CH3), it's a substituent.

Wait, maybe in reality, each of these carbons (C2 and C3) is a CH(CH3), but for each, their four substituents would be:

C2:

- One substituent is COOH.

- Two substituents are H?

Wait, that would mean the groups are:

COOH, CH(CH3)-CH(CH3), H, H. Which would not give four distinct substituents—thus, not chiral.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, in 2,3-dimethyl succinic acid, each of the internal carbons is CH(CH3). So each has two CH3 and two H as substituents?

No...

Actually, wait, C2 is CH(CH3):

So:

- bonded to C1 (which is COOH).

- bonded to three other atoms: perhaps two H and C3, which is also CH(CH3).

Wait, that's a problem because if C2 has substituents: COOH (from C1), two H, and C3.

In that case, it's not a chiral center because it only has three different substituents (COOH, C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two H's, so one of the substituents is same as another (two Hs). Similarly for C3.

But wait, in the problem, the configurations are 2R and 3S. So maybe I'm wrong? Because for a chiral center, the substituents have to be four distinct groups. So I must have connected this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbons are connected as:

Carbons in order are:

COOH—C1 (has two COOH? No, wait, in succinic acid, there are two Carboxylic acid groups at each end, at C1 and C4.

So, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So the substituents on C2 would be:

- Left: -CH2-COOH (perhaps written as R1).
- Right: -CH(CH3)-CH2 (wait, no, C3 would have a methyl as well? No.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to accept that if (2R,3S) are specified, and it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the molecule is a meso compound? Like, has a plane of symmetry?

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on the 2 and 3 positions would make each CH(CH3), but without any symmetry, unless it's a center.

Wait, but with both the 2 and 3 positions being R and S, respectively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, the mirror image would mean that any configuration is reflected, making it a meso compound.

Wait, for instance, the structure of 2,3-dimethyl-butanedioc acid. If the substituents are such that when you switch R and S, you get a mirror image, then the molecule is meso.

So, if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to mirror images which are superimposable, the molecule is meso and hence not chiral.

Wait, how would that work?

For a compound like tartaric acid, the meso form is when (R,S) configuration leads to internal compensation due to the mirror plane (like a plane bisecting the central C-C bond in the molecule). So succinic acid, when 2,3-dimethyl, if it has that symmetry, it would form a meso compound and thus be achiral.

Wait, in our case, the configuration is (2R,3S), so the left and right groups aren't identical.

Wait, for example, in a (2R,3S) configuration, substituents on adjacent chiral centers might make the molecule a meso structure, so making it achiral.

Alternatively, maybe no, they are not equivalent.

Wait, maybe this molecule is a meso compound, so it wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, if the two central carbons are (R) and (S) configuration, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the molecule is symmetric across the central C2-C3 bond, then (R,S) would be equivalent in mirror image. But I'm not sure about that.

The structure would be:

COOH-CH(CH3) - CH(CH3)-COOH, perhaps with the substituents arranged where on each (C2 and C3), their substituents are such that the groups create symmetry. If so, the molecule would be a meso form, and hence, not chiral.

So perhaps this compound is meso, so not chiral and thus not optically active.

Then, after trying to wrap my head around that, perhaps this compound is meso, which would mean it's optically inactive.

But wait, wait a second. If the configurations are R and S on adjacent carbons, which are equidistant from a potential plane of symmetry, would the molecule be meso?

If that is the case, then yes, the molecule would be a meso compound and hence not chiral. So it's not optically active.

The presence of (2R,3S) might imply that if it's a symmetric structure, it's a meso form. So in this case, the molecule has two chiral centers, but due to the symmetry, the overall molecule is achiral. So no optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

OK, same as above but with both R configurations.

If the molecule is symmetric or not.

Wait, if the configurations are both R, then perhaps each center is R in a molecule that's symmetric.

If the substituents around C2 and C3 are mirror images, then the entire molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but if all groups on each are same, then no symmetry.

Wait, let's structure it similarly.

Another scenario: Earlier, (2R,3S) if symmetric, would be meso, but this is (2R,3R), which perhaps doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Because in this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 might not mirror each other.

Alternatively, evaluate each for chiral centers again.

If (2R,3R) and each is a chiral center, but the structure lacks a middle plane of symmetry, then the two chiral centers make the molecule chiral.

Wait, in this case, the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the configurations are same on both centers. So it can't be meso and should be chiral, thus optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

Okay, this is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 1 and with a double bond starting at carbon 3.

So the ring has substituents: hydroxyl on C1, and the double bond between C3 and C4.

Do the substituents create a chiral center?

Carbon 1: The cyclohexane ring. If cyclohex-3-ene, the ring is numbered accordingly.

So within the ring, the hydroxyl group is on C1. Let's imagine C1 is connected to C2, which is adjacent to C3, which is double bonded to C4.

At C1: what are the substituents?

It's part of the ring, so connected to C2 and C6 (since rings are cyclical). The OH is on C1.

So for a cyclohexanol, the C1 has the OH. So if the C1 is a chiral center, then.

For C1's substituents:

a) –OH

b) –CH2 groups on each, leading to C2 and C6.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanering, each internal carbon is bonded to two CH2 groups (except for substituents). Wait, is the C1 in cyclohexanol a chiral center?

In cyclohexanol, the molecule is I think a chair conformation, but in terms of bond structure, each carbon in the cyclohexane ring is connected to two others in the ring, two more CH2 groups, potentially, and perhaps substituents.

Wait, no, in cyclohexanol: the carbons are CH2 or CH groups.

C1 has an OH group. So substituents on C1 are -OH, –CH2-C2, –CH2-C6, and a double bond elsewhere?

Wait, no, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is at C3 and C4, and the substitution is at C1.

So C1 of the ring:.

Groups:

–OH,

–C2 (connected to C1 and C3),

–C6 (also adjacent),

but wait, wait wait.

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is joined to two adjacent carbons. So for C1, the substituents are: the ring (so two bonds: one to C2, one to C6), but these are both part of the ring. The third substituent is the –OH group, and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, correcting: no. Each carbon in the ring has four bonds, including two to other ring carbons, and two for other substituents. In cyclohexanol, C1: has –OH, and two CH2 groups (or CH, depending on substituents).

Wait, any carbon in the ring in a cyclohexane can't have four substituents besides being part of the ring. So maybe C1 is CH with –OH and two CH2 groups (H's).

But wait, in that case, is C1 a chiral center?

Wait, the substituents would be:

–OH,

–CH2 (connected to C2),

–CH2 (connected to C6),

and a single H.

But in that case, substituents aren't all different:

Groups would be OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. So CH2 groups are same because they are each attached to a C2 and C6 (but which may or may not be same). But actually, each CH2 group is connected to separate positions in the ring. So will that create four distinct substituents?

Wait, in structure, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 in ring, and –OH, and a H. So if the cyclohexane ring isn't symmetric, then perhaps those substituents would make C1 a chiral center.

Ah, but I think because in the cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, when the ring is flat (since there's a double bond now), the substituents might be arranged such that the C1 has four different groups.

So substituents:

–OH,

–the adjacent ring in one direction (which is C2 with substituents from the ring, perhaps including the double bond), and in the other direction (C6, potentially similar substituents),

and a hydrogen.

Wait, actually, perhaps the ring causes the substituents (groups around C1) to have only three unique substituents. For example:

On C1, the ring is arranged (so to the left, there's the positions leading from C2, and to the right, leading from C6), but the substituent groups are the same. Hence, C1 perhaps only has three different substituents: OH, CH2, and H. Or perhaps it has more.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this again. For a ring with a double bond, the C1 would have different substituents depending on the geometry of the ring.

Wait, perhaps this molecule is such that C1 has an OH group, a CH2 group (in the direction to C2), another CH2 (in the direction to C6), and a hydrogen. So even though the two CH2 groups are in different locations, they both have the same type of substituents (just adjacent ring members), maybe leading to identical substituents.

But if the adjacent substituents are different because the ring has substituents in certain positions, then all four substituents would be unique.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents in the directions would lead to different arrangements. The ring is a cyclohexene, so adjacent positions may or may not lead to C1 being a chiral center.

An alternative approach might be to remember that in cyclohexanol, the molecule is not chiral, but when substituted, it becomes chiral. For example, when the substituent is on C1, but if the substituent creates four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

Also, (R)-configured implies that the molecule is chiral. So if it's supposed to have an R configuration, it must have a chiral center, so it's optically active.

Thus, this compound should be active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

Ah, three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane. At C1, C3, C5, each with S configuration. So the substituents: each of these are configurations for the triol substituents.

Now, without looking into detailed symmetry, let's evaluate whether all three centers are chiral.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, assuming all substituents (OH, and the ring bonds) are the same.

But in reality, even if each replacing of H with OH, Now, arranged at 1,3,5 positions (every other carbon). So the cyclohexane is symmetric about certain planes.

Do the OH groups at 1,3,5 make the molecule symmetric such that it's a meso compound? Like in the case of meso-triphenylene triol.

Alternatively, when considering all three hydroxyl groups on the ring, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, perhaps it's achiral.

Wait, in 1,3,5-triol, if the substituents on symmetry opposite positions mirror each other, it would mean the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, thus it's meso.

But in this compound, does the molecule have such a plane of symmetry?

The positions are 1,3,5 which are spaced two carbons apart each time, so they form a triangle on the ring. This type of arrangement means that the molecule may not possess a center of inversion, but might have a plane.

Perhaps the molecule actually is a meso compound with (1s,3s,5s) configuration but is superimposable on its mirror image, thus no optical activity.

But wait, the D ata can be tricky. Alternatively, maybe this structure isn't a meso compound. Let me think.

 In (1s,3s,5s), each OH at 1,3,5, arranged so that each is on the same face, perhaps, but given the chair conformation, perhaps the spatial arrangement may cause a net chiral molecule.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in the same configuration (S), which may lead to symmetry across the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps due to the positions and configurations, it leads to an overall achiral arrangement.

I think that when all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration, but arranged in a triangular symmetric way (1,3,5-triols), the compound may be achiral because the overall structure is symmetric. Hence, no optical activity.

So this compound might be a meso or symmetric molecule.

Wait, another perspective: let's consider mirror symmetry. If you have three substituents (OH) at 1,3,5 positions, then a plane cutting through the center of the ring (as a point of inversion) would mirror each OH in a way that the structure remains same, making the molecule a meso form.

Thus, it might not be chiral, leading to no optical activity.

Alternatively, perhaps upon arranging all substituents in the same configuration, but on a symmetric ring, the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry.

Thus, meso, so no optical activity.

Confused here, but perhaps I'll keep this thought and see later.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Hmm, this is a 4-carbon ketone (butanone) with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl group on C3.

Wait, the structure is: the ketone is at C1. So, butan-1-one is O=C(CH2CH2CH3). But with substituents.

Wait, but the structure of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

O=C(–C5H9)–CH2–CH(CH3)–? Wait, let me re-express:

Butan-1-one is:

O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2– ?

Wait, no, butan-1-one is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But with substituents: 3-methyl would move the methyl to C3. Wait, but the structure is:

O=C–(Cyclopentyl)–CH2–[and then what? The structure after cyclopentyl?]

Wait, let me correct.  Butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–(CH2)3–CH3 ? No, wait but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, when it's methylacetone, but I could be getting this wrong.

Wait, butan-1-one is: on carbon 1, the ketone group. So structure is:

O=C–R, where R is the remaining three carbons.

Wait, actual structure:

O=C–R, R is -(CH2)m-... something.

Wait, butan-1-one is methylene-propane-? No, perhaps better to picture the structure as:

Butan-1-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 1, so the compound is pentan-2-one? No, wait butan means four carbons, four carbon chain.

Butan-1-one: it would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. Because that's a four carbon chain with the ketone at the end (since butan-1-one).

Wait, but normally, butanone is 2-butanone (which is methylacetone), but butan-1-one would be .

So the starting molecule: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So, the structure would be:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–? No, wait, butan-1-one has four carbons. So structure is:

O=C–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–? Wait, no. Oops, phew, perhaps better structure.

But butan-1-one has four carbons in the chain, with the ketone at position 1. So:

O=C–X–Y–Z.

X, Y, Z would each be CH2.

But then we have substituents.

In this compound, X is a cyclopentyl group; Y is CH(CH3), Y is the third carbon.

Wait, more accurately, the molecule would be:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–(CH2CH3), but with a methyl substituent on the butanone.

Wait, perhaps it goes like this:

Position 1: O=C– attached to CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better step-wise.

Butan-1-one: positions are 1: carbonyl, 2, 3, 4.

So in this compound, 3rd carbon has a methyl group, and the 1st carbon has a cyclopentyl substituent.

Wait, so the actual structure would be:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)– ??

Wait no, but butan-1-one would have four carbons. 

Maybe, it's like:

1 (O=C–), 2 (CH2–), 3 (CH(CH3)–), and 4 (CH3? Or another CH2– something).

Hmm, getting a bit stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (cyclopentyl)–O=C–CH2–CH(CH3).

Wait, the question is about chirality.

In any case, the molecule has a ketone group (O=C–).

But in butanone, the carbonyl is on C1. Hence, the butan-1-one structure is O=C–R, where R is CH2CH2CH3? Or wait, that would be a three carbon chain, hence propanoate. No, I'm getting tripped up.

In any case, substituents on carbons 3 and 1: cyclopentyl on C1, methyl on C3.

Would that substituent arrangement create any chiral centers?

Let's say butan-1-one is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2.

Wait, but chain is longer if butan-1-one— wait, perhaps I should think in terms of connectivity.

Alternate approach: the molecule is:

(Cyclopentyl)–C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)–... wait, how many carbons.

Wait, I suspect that the molecule has C1 (carbonyl), then two more carbons, and another.

 perhaps in any case, unless carbon 3 has a chiral arrangement, but it's more about if any chiral centers exist.

So for the 3-methyl group, at carbon 3: maybe it's attached to:

- carbon 2 (from carbonyl)

- a CH2 group leading to C4

But what are the substituents on C3?

- CH₂ (from C2, which is CH₂– the original chain)

- Two CH3 groups? Because of the methyl substitution.

Wait, perhaps we can assess whether C3 is a chiral center.

Is C3 connected to four different substituents?

Where:

– group on one side comes from C2: which would be a CH₂ group.

– then itself has CH3.

– a hydrogen.

(Wait, the groups would be something like:

At C3:

1. The main chain: from C2, which is (following from C1 )

Sorry, maybe this is taking too long. Perhaps without more clarity, the other structures would be more straightforward.

But cyclopentyl is a substituent but non-chiral itself.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent cyclopentyl and methyl made it so that any carbon in the butanone chain is a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe if the substituents on C3 are leading to no chiral center.

In this case, maybe the molecule isn't chiral and thus isn't active.

Alternatively, perhaps not. I'll have to come back to this.

Mentally, perhaps my final tally would be [made up from what I think].

So, let's go back to each compound:

1: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Check again. To see if any chiral center.

C1 is attached to Cl, double bond to C2.

Wait, in sp² hybridization, C1 can’t be chiral center, no.
C2 is part of a double bond; so, C2 has double bonds to C1 and perhaps another substituent.

Hmm, but that probably doesn't make a chiral center either.

So, this compound doesn't have a chiral center — no optical activity. Or perhaps...

Wait another way: the phenyl groups on each side of a double bond, but no, here it's not. So no chiral centers here, so no activity.

Wait, but wait, wait, but the substituents on either side of the double bond can sometimes produce a center elsewhere. Not in this case. Both ends at C1 and C2 are CH2 and such.

So, likely, this molecule is not chiral, no optical activity.

Ok, moving on.

2: I think I earlier said yes. This has R and S configurations, possibly leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, the (3aR,7aS,E) indicates specific stereochemistry in the ring structure. That likely leads to no plane of symmetry, so chiral, so active.

Compound 2: optically active.

3: The (2R,3S)– analyzing, possibly the molecule is a meso form. Thus, not active. So no.

4: (2R,3R): two R configurations. So no symmetry; thus, not a meso compound. Thus, chiral → Optically active.

Compound 4: active.

5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: 

Earlier I tentatively said has a chiral center, so active.

Thus, entry 5: active.

6: (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane triol: I'm not sure. Thought it might be meso → inactive.

But, with three substituents on a symmetric arrangement ( every other C), maybe it's a meso or not.

Wait, perhaps in the symmetric substitution with three stereogenic centers equally spaced, the molecule could be a meso with respect to some gradients. Alternatively, perhaps whether the substituents' configurations result in a non-superimposable mirror image.

Wait, israely? Failing that, perhaps I should just see according to the number of stereogenic centers and then as per the symmetry.

If all three are s, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, (1s,3s,5s) CRL in a yeah, in a symmetric molecule would form a R,R,R which mirrors to S,S,S. So would be a different spot.

But, perhaps in this specific case, the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, hence chiral. Without knowing, perhaps in the question, it depends on whether the molecule is a meso-triol.

Alternatively, the compound would have cyclic symmetry, making it a meso form.

If the three OHs are placed opposite to each other via C2, C4, C6, but for a 1,3,5-triol, it's arranged symmetrically. Wait, maybe it's a bridge between chair conformations.

But perhaps I'll accept this as being meso and not active.

7: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Did it have a chiral center?

Alternatively, but if the carbons are arranged such that a carbon attached to four different groups, perhaps C3?

C3 would be attached to:

- The cyclopentyl group on core.

- Or, perhaps, no.

Wait, to sum, perhaps but the substituentsmay not create a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps because of the substituents cyclopentyl and methyl are on different chains, but in this molecule, no four different substituents for any carbon.

Thus, not active.

So, let's list each compound's activity:

1: No → inactive.

2: Yes → active.

3: (2R,3S) perhaps → meso → inactive.

4: (2R,3R) → active.

5: Yes → active.

6: (1s,3s,5s) → may be meso → inactive.

7: No → inactive.

Wait, wait.

Wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:

Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, but with perhaps substituents.

Another way: if the molecule is (cyclopentyl)COCH2CH(CH3).

Jeez, perhaps this is, but that would not necessarily create a chiral center.

So 7: Inactive.

Thus, reviewing:

Opt活性的化合物:

2: active.

4: active.

5: active.

Another.

Wait, number 6 review: If it's (1s,3s,5s), perhaps not a meso compound.

Wait, in my previous analysis, I thought 6 is meso. but what if it's not?

Another strategy: think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Three substituents at 1,3,5.</mirroring when plane passes through center.

Each substituent is S.

If mirror image reflects their configuration, distribute the same. No, because each (s) would have opposite.

Wait, for (1s,3s,5s), in a symmetric drawing, perhaps the mirror across a plane would turn each s into a r.

Wait, does this imply that the mirror image is R,R,R which is different → so the molecule can't superimpose → hence chiral. Hence, number 6 is active.

Hmm, that would change the count.

Thus, number 6: active.

Wow, this is getting tricky.

Let me relook.

Number 1: inactive.

Number 2: yes.

Number 3: no.

Number 4: yes.

Number 5: yes.

Number 6: ?

Yes, because (1s,3s,5s) has no plane of symmetry? which would make it a chiral molecule.

So in that case, 6 is active.

Number 7: no.

So now revised active count:

2,4,5,6 → four active compounds.

So 4 compounds.

Let's count:

1. inactive.

2. Active→ yes.

3. (example no).

4. Yes.

5. yes.

6. yes.

7. no.

So total of 4 would be the answer.

But wait, COMPOUND GRAND TOTAL.

Number 0:

Wait, going back.

Compounds:

a) The actual opt compounds are 2,4,5,6 → four in total.

Wait, wait, taskemment, the given options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, options given in the question are:

Each of the compounds must be determined (a total of seven). Of those seven, how many are active?

Let me reassess all compounds now.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no chiral centers. So, no.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: yes.

3. (2R,3S): meso → no.

4. (2R,3R): active → yes.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: yes.

6.(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-ol: is it active? My initial thought is changed because if it's not a meso compound, will be active.

Alternatively, perhaps it is an active.

Probably, but I'm still unsure, but let's treat it as active.

7. I think in this case, no, as discussed earlier.

Thus, compounds 2,4,5,6 → four. So answer is D)4.

What about compound 7?

Another perspective: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Structure: cyclopentyl group as substituent on C1, methyl on C3.

Would that create any chiral centers?

Side question: C3 has structure CH(CH3).

Wait, substitute Chiral center condition.

At C3:

- It's connected to C2 (which is (CH2) leading to carbonyl).

So substituents:

Carbonyl-C, cyclopentyl (maybe not on C3?), no,:

Wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

One CH2 from C2 which is part of the butanone.

Then, the substituents of C3.

At C3, perhaps:

– two CH2 groups

– CH3 (the methyl substituent )

– and a hydrogen.

Thus, maybe all four substituents.

So four substituents for C3:

a) CH(CH₂C(O)R)

No, this gets too confusing. But I think C3 in this molecule doesn't have four unique substituents.

Wait, without the exact structure, perhaps this won't be a chiral center.

Thus, thinking that 7 is not active.

Thus, the total count is 4 (comounds 2,4,5,6).

Options: D)4. So the question claims these are in the given list with 7 positions.

Wait, the initial input lists seven compounds, each above:

The first one we called no activity.

The count being four, option D.
</think>

To determine how many of the given compounds are optically active, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center and lacks a plane of symmetry or is not a meso compound. Here's the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- This compound contains a double bond with substituents arranged in the (Z) configuration. However, the carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, no other chiral centers are present in the molecule.
- **Optical activity**: No.

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
- This is a bicyclic compound with defined stereochemistry at specific chiral centers (3aR and 7aS). The
