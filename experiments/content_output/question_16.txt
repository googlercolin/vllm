(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
A) 5
B) 3
C) 2
D) 4

Assistant Response:
To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to identify those that contain asymmetric carbon atoms (chiral centers). A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center and exists in at least two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene** - Contains a double bond, but no carbon atoms are linked to four different groups, so it is not chiral.
2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** - The structure suggests the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms, indicating it could be chiral.
3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** - Both碳原子2 and 3 are chiral centers.
4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** - Also has chiral centers at碳原子2 and 3.
5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** - Cyclohexane ring is planar, and the -OH group on a chiral carbon makes it chiral.
6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol** - Chiral center at碳原子1.
7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one** - The carbonyl group (-CO-) and the attachment of cyclopentyl group on a chiral carbon (carbon 3) could indicate a chiral center.

By analyzing each compound, we can determine that compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have chiral centers and can exhibit optical activity. Therefore, 6 compounds exhibit optical activity.
