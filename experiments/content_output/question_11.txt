Question: All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except



A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

C) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

Assistant Response:
The correct answer is found by evaluating each statement for its accuracy based on current molecular biology knowledge of SARS-CoV-2.

A) This statement suggests that the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. Research indicates that the nsp14 ExoN domain is involved in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities, and nsp10 is a regulatory protein that acts on nsp14. However, there is no well-established evidence supporting the mechanism described here as the primary function of this complex in SARS-CoV-2, though they do play roles in RNA processing and protection.

B) This statement accurately reflects the known ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a to initiate apoptosis via caspase-8 and affect the extrinsic apoptotic pathway without influencing Bcl-2, which is crucial for the intrinsic pathway.

C) The statement about the frameshifting rate and the number of conformations that pseudoknots can adopt is correct. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize similar mechanisms involving pseudoknots to mediate programmed frameshifting.

D) This statement accurately describes the molecular mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2, involving a slippery sequence, pseudoknot, and resulting in the creation of two polyproteins.

The incorrect statement is A.

Answer: A
