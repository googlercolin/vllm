Question: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

A) 10^-9 eV
B) 10^-11 eV
C) 10^-4 eV
D) 10^-8 eV


Assistant Response:
To determine the energy difference that could clearly distinguish these two energy levels, we need to consider the time resolution required to resolve the difference between the two lifetimes. The energy resolution required to distinguish two closely spaced energy levels is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which in this context can be roughly expressed as:

\[ \Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar/2 \]

where \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, and \(\Delta t\) is the time resolution. For clarity, we typically use a time resolution that is an order of magnitude smaller than the lifetimes of the states. 

Here, the lifetimes are \(10^{-9}\) sec and \(10^{-8}\) sec, so a time resolution of \(10^{-10}\) sec would be appropriate to clearly distinguish between them.

Using \(\hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\):

\[ \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t} = \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}}{2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \]

Converting this energy into electron volts (1 eV = 1.602 \(\times\) 10^-19 J):

\[ \Delta E \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \]

Since the energy difference must be significantly larger than the \(\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}\) eV to clearly resolve the two energy levels, the option closest to this value is:

\[ 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \]
