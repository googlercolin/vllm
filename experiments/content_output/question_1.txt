Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. So, it says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy and the lifetime of a particle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is roughly on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But I think when considering the natural linewidth in energy levels due to their finite lifetimes, the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime τ. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

But wait, the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So this must relate to the energy resolution needed. Maybe the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait, I think the uncertainty in energy for each state would be of the order of ħ / (lifetime). So, which energy uncertainty do I take here? Because the question is asking about the energy difference between E1 and E2 that allows them to be resolved.

Alternatively, when measuring the energy levels, the time available to make a measurement would impact the energy resolution. So perhaps the measurement time relates to the uncertainties of each state. Though the problem states the lifetimes, which determine how long each state can be observed before it decays, how does that influence the energy resolution of distinguishing E1 and E2?

Wait another thought... If you have two states, the instrument used must be able to resolve energy differences on the order of at least the uncertainty of each state. If the energy difference is much larger than the combined uncertainties, they can resolve them.

But the problem might be suggesting to calculate the minimum energy difference required for clear distinction. So, I think the formula would be something around ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/(something), but how exactly?

The energy-time uncertainty relation says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π. The Δt in this case could be the lifetime of the state. Wait, I'll get into it.

For each state, State 1 has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 s, and State 2 has τ2 = 1e-8 s. The natural linewidth for each state is about ħ/(τ). So, the uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 = ħ/(τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(τ2).

But we want to make sure the energy difference between E2 and E1 is larger than the sum of their uncertainties so they can be distinguished. So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2. Wait, or maybe is it enough that it's larger than the maximum of the two, or perhaps the sum. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be about the same order as the individual uncertainties.

Let me calculate. Plug in numbers.

Given Planck's constant ħ. Well, ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To get it in eVolts, because the options are in eV. Let me compute the energy uncertainty for each state using their τ.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.05e-25 J. To convert J to eV, since 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J. So, ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converted to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, but those are the values for each. So, to have a clear distinction, E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum? Or equals the sum?

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't reach such magnitude. Checking options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than our values of about ≥1e-7 eV.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in exponents. Let's compute again carefully.

Exact calculation:

Convert ΔE1 in eV: 

ΔE1 = ħ/(tau1)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s
= 1.0545718e-25 J.

1 J = 6.242e12 eV, correct? Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so J / eV = 1 / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.242e18.

Wait, sorry, let me compute 1 J in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → So, 1 J is about 1/(1.602e-19) eV = approx 6.242e18 eV.

Wait, no, wait: Let's compute how many eV are 1 J. So:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → Therefore,

1 J = 1 / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So, to get the energy in eV,

ΔE1_J = 1.0545718e-25 J,

ΔE1_eV = 1.0545718e-25 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J)

= 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 → (1.0545718 / 1.602) * e-6. Because 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6.

1.0545718 / 1.602 ≈ approx 0.658 → 0.658e-6 eV → 6.58e-7 eV, which is about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2: tau2=1e-8 s,

ΔE2_eV: (1.0545718e-34 J.s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert that to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 = 1e-7 * 0.658 → 0.658e-7 eV, which is 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is around 6.5e-7 eV, and ΔE2 6.5e-8 eV.

So, for the two energy levels E1 and E2, we want their separation to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if E2 - E1 is much larger than either's uncertainty, they can be clearly resolved.

So, 10^-4 eV is much larger than that. Let me check each option.

Option A: 1e-9 eV → Hmm, that's 1e-9. About 0.001 times ΔE2. So, if separation is 1e-9 and ΔE1 is 6.5e-7, doesn't that mean it's about 1.5 times smaller? So, lower than the required.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → Even smaller. So worse than A.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → Oh wait that's 1e-4. Which is much larger than 6.5e-7 (because 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065, and 1e-4 is 0.0001; actually, 1e-4 is much bigger). So 1e-4 eV is like 1,537 times larger than Delta E1. Wait no, wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 /6.5e-7 ≈ 1,538 times bigger. So the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, and the uncertainty is 6.5e-7 eV. Well above that.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1538 times larger than ΔE2. And 0.001538 times Delta E1? Wait, Delta E1 is about 6.5e-7, so 1e-8 is 1/65 of that. So if E2 - E1 is 1e-8, and the uncertainty for E1 is ~6.5e-7, then the separation is 1e-8 is smaller than 6.5e-7, so they wouldn't be resolvable.

Wait, but E2 is another state with its own uncertainty. So combining the uncertainties together, perhaps the separation should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2?

Wait, no, higher would be better. So E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum? Let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2 is about 6.5e-7 + 6.5e-8 → that's 7.15e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be more than ~7e-7 eV to be easily distinguishable. Let's check the options: Option C is way bigger, about 1e-4 which is 1e-4 = 1e4e-7 (wait no, 1e-4 is 0.0001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001 → 0.0001 is ten thousand times larger).

So option C is way higher than the needed separation. So the energy differences in higher magnitude than the individual uncertainties would be resolved. Thus the correct answer is C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the energy uncertainties associated with each state. The energy uncertainty for a state is determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \), where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the given lifetimes:
- \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) (for \( E_1 \)),
- \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) (for \( E_2 \)),

The energy uncertainties are:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
\[
\Delta E \geq 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than the required \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be resolved.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than the required \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels can be clearly resolved.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than the required \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be resolved.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
