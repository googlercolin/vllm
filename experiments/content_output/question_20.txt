Question: A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
A) 1,2,4
B) 2,3,4
C) 1,2,3
D) 1,3,4

Assistant Response:
The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies the interaction by assuming that the interaction current only acts on the nucleon it is interacting with directly and treating that nucleon as if it were not influenced by the nuclear environment. This involves several assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

While the third statement is related to the non-relativistic nature of quarks, it is not directly an assumption that leads to the impulse approximation.

Therefore, the correct assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:

1 and 4.
