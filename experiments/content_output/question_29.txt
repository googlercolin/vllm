Question: You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>
A) Mutant 2
B) Mutant 3
C) Mutant 1
D) Mutant 4

Assistant Response:
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question here about barley genes and mutations, and I need to figure out which mutant will eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. Hmm, I remember that genes are composed of exons and introns, but the important thing is the exons because those are the parts that get expressed into the protein. So the gene has five exons and four introns, meaning when it's transcribed, the introns are spliced out and only the exons remain.

The wild-type gene is given, and the mutants are shown with sequences. I need to find which mutation would probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Wait, I think this is about the compound being made by a protein encoded by the gene, right? So if the gene is altered such that the protein isn't made, the compound won't be synthesized, meaning it's eliminated.

The question says the compound is anti-nutritional, and it's the product of this gene. All mutants have changes in the first exon. But the first exon is part of the mRNA, so any mutation there might affect the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, I need to look for changes that either disrupt the reading frame, cause a premature stop codon, or otherwise prevent the protein from being made. Because that would stop the compound from being made, helping the barley cultivar.

Let's break down each option:

Terminator codons are TGA, TAG, and TAA. So, in the given gene sequences, all end with TGA, so if a mutation creates an early stop, that could truncate the protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
The original starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...
Mutant 1: -ATGTTCTACGCT... So comparing that, the eighth base might have changed.
Original exon part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA..., and Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCT... Wait, the sequence changes a few bases, potentially changing amino acids, but does it cause an early stop? Let me see.

I think I should look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation (a stop codon). Frameshift would change the reading frame, altering all downstream amino acids, but these are in the first exon; but would the mutation affect the start or cause a premature stop?

Looking for where changes happen. Let's go step by step.

Wild type: ATG TT TCT CGC TGG TAC TT...
Wild type's start codon is ATG, then TTT becomes Phe, TCT Ser, CGC Arg, etc.

Looking at Mutant1 sequence:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGT... So the original after ATG is TT TCT CGC TGG...
Mutant1 after ATG is TT CT ACG CTG GT. So the sequence at position 5 is altered. Let me see the codons:

Original (wild-type):

After ATG:
positions:
1: TTT (Phe)
2: TCT (Ser)
3: CGC (Arg)
4: GGT (Gly)
V ... But wait, the actual sequence comparison is better.

Comparing each part:

Wild type: ATG TT TCT CGC TGG TAC TTCT...
Mutant1: ATG TT CT ACG CTG GTTT... Wait, not sure, perhaps.

Wait the wild type: the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1 is ATG TTCTACGCT... Wait, perhaps the 'C' in the third codon changes. Let me write out the codons.

Original Wild type:

Exon 1:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CG C...

Wait, maybe numbering isn't right, but perhaps each line is presented as a single strand? Hmm, perhaps the best way is to look for stop codons.

But wait, all the mutants and the wild type end with the same TGA. The given sequences start from 5’[...] end with TGA so perhaps all sequences in each mutant have the same ending. So any early stop would require looking for TGA earlier.

Looking through each mutant's sequence to see if any TGA appears before the end.

Wild type is normal, ends with TGA. So each mutant also ends with TGA, but their sequences are based on different changes.

For each mutant, examine the alleles. Particularly, any new TGA appearing earlier.

Let's check.

For Mutant 1:

Sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGT... Looking for any TGA before the end. Let me think; The original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So the end occurs with TGA in the middle perhaps? Wait, in the wild type provided, 'TGA' is present at the end, in the middle of the sequence, but it's possible another TGA might occur.

Wait, in the wild type, the given sequence is [...GTCGT…TGA-3’]. So I see TGA in the middle. Hmm? So maybe wild type actually contains TGA in the middle, but that's before the end... but perhaps that's an internal stop. No, that can't be right because the wild type gene product is being made. So perhaps the TGA at the end is the stop codon. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the DNA sequence is written as [...GTCGT…TGA-3’]; this is the coding strand which is similar to mRNA. Wait, the 5’- to 3’ strand.

Wait, in DNA sequencing, it's usually the coding (sense) strand that matches the mRNA. The stop codon in the mRNA would be at the end, so in DNA, it would correspond to complementary to the stop codon at the end.

Wait, but mutation sequences are all shown as 5’ to 3’, so the original is ...TGA-3’, same for the mutants. So TGA is the stop codon. So any occurrence of TGA before the end would cause premature stop.

Are any mutants introducing another TGA in the middle of their sequences?

Looking at each mutant:

Looking at Mutant1:

Original sequence starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1 is ATG TTT [CT changes? No, wait, better look.

Wait the question says all the mutations are in the first exon, so I can look at the changes.

Wild type Exon 1 (start of DNA given): 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

So wild-type exon1 (from start) is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGG... Wait in position 3 onwards, there are changes. Let's look for a new TGA in any part.

In Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTAC...

Does any triplet form TGA? Let me check. ATG (start), TT is third and fourth? 

Break the sequence into triplets.

Mutant1 sequence: 5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT G... etc. Wait no, that's whether it's wild type.

Wait I'm a bit stuck. Let me write some nucleotide sequences for the mutants.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: 

Looking at the first 20 bases or so:

Mutant1: 5’ [ATG] TT [CTC to CT A? I don't think so ].

Wait the first part of mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGT...

Breaking it down as codons:

ATG (start), then to see the next bases: 

After ATG, the mutant sequence is TTCTACGCTG... So break into triplets (after ATG).

- TTT (that comes from TTTC, which is in the wild type original, but in mutant1, it's T T-C, does that change? Wait perhaps I should align the two.

Wild type: at the start, the exons are ATG TTT CTC GCT... 

Mutant 1's sequence is: ATG TTCTACGCT... So the second codon is T仡 (same as wild-type?), third codon CTC in wild becomes CT A... Wait.

Wait, perhaps looking for modified codons, determining for any of the codons whether they result in a stop codon in the translated protein.

Alternatively, perhaps some mutations cause a frameshift (insertion/deletion of nucleotides that's not a multiple of 3) which changes the reading frame, causing downstream codons to be wrong and possibly leading to a frameshift mutation and eventually a premature stop.

Looking for insertions or deletions.

Examining each variant:

Mutant1:

Original has from first exon: the mutant sequence is in the first exon. Let me compare specific positions.

Looking line by line, Wild-type has bends like TCT CGC, in the sequence:

Wild-type initial sequence:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So in Mutant1, instead of TTCTC, it's TTCTA, and so CG instead of CG? Wait perhaps better to look for where in the sequence the nucleotides change.

Wait perhaps in the third codon of the gene. Let me look for exact letters.

Wild type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant1 starts with ATG TTT CT AC ...

Wait not sure, perhaps the third codon (CTC) changes to CT A? I think perhaps there is a C to A substitution.

So in the wild, the third codon is CTC (Arg), which becomes ACT? Wait, that's a different thing.

Wait, perhaps I should list exact matches.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT A etc. (simplified).

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGC... Hmm, wait maybe initial triplets vary.

Wait, let me see:

Wild-type: from 5' to 3':

positions: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: TCT, 10-12: CGC, etc.

Mutant1: 5' begins with same first 7: ATG TTT (up to position 4), then position7: what's after? How?

Actually, perhaps that's too time-consuming. Let's look for any mutations that insert or delete bases (which would induce a frameshift) and thus likely produce a premature stop.

Alternatively, any mutations creating new in-frame TGA stop codons.

Looking quickly:

Wild-type has the last three nucleotides as TGA for the stop codon. Each mutant also ends with TGA, so perhaps the only changes are in the middle. Hmm.

Mutant4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCT ACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait in the third part: ...GCT ACT... So the codon after, maybe, the fourth?

Wait, perhaps there's a CGT changing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can note that the first ten bases are:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CT CGC TGG TAC.

Mutant4: starts as ATG TTTTAC GCT ACT.

Hmm... comparing, what's changing here. It looks like in the beginning, maybe a T is inserted or something. Alternatively, perhaps in the initial part.

Looking for frameshifts:

If a nucleotide is inserted or deleted, and the count isn't a multiple of three, the reading frame will shift.

Each line:

Mutant4:

Original had 5' of ATG TTT CTC GCT... So the third codon is TCT ( Serg ), next CGC ( Arg ).

In Mutant4:

The sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT.

Wait, after ATG TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT. Maybe that's changed from the original.

So if code looks as:

Wildtype: first few codons are ATG, TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT,...

Mutant4: ATG, TTT (wait, ttt is TTT, but then it has TAC. So from position 4-6: TAC. That could be a substitution in the third codon.

Wait, let me think about it:

Wild-type third codon is CTC (Ser), but in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). That's a substitution. So perhaps no frameshift here.

Looking for any possible insertions or deletions.

Alternatively, if a frame is shifted, so when you look at the codons which are 3n, 3n+1, 3n+2.

Wait, but any in-frame stop would require TGA within the sequence.

One strategy: which of these mutations introduces an early TGA in the exon 1, leading to a truncated protein which is likely non-functional.

So let's analyze each mutant:

Wild type ex1 ends in TGA as a stop. Each mutant has ex1 mutation.

Mutant1 vs. Wild:

Wild: ...TCGCTGGT...

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGG...

So DNA sequence comparison:

Wild type segment: TCGC ..., looking for triplet TGA.

Mutant1 has in its early region (exon1) perhaps changed a C to A? Hmm, looking:

Mutant1: ...TACG... So perhaps in some codon, but not old.

Wait, in wild type, after ATG is TTT CT CGC TGG TAC.

In mutant1, let's imagine the DNA changes from TCG to TCA somewhere. So maybe a C→A change at position X.

So each triplet:

Wild:
ATG -> Met
TTT -> Phe
CTC -> Ser
GCT -> Ala
GGT -> Gly
ACT -> Thr
TCT -> Ser
GTG -> Val
GAT -> Asp
GAA -> Glu etc.

Mutant1: its sequence starts with ATG, then a change in the fourth codon? Let's see.

Mutant1: ATG TTT [CT change], but perhaps like, looking for any site in which the triplet leads to a stop.

Alternatively, another approach: count the base pairs before stop codon ends.

In the wild, first exon is part of mRNA. Any mutation altering the sequence can change the amino acids.

The question is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound synthesized by this gene. Therefore, the most likely way is to disrupt the coding sequence to render the protein non-functional.

Option D: Mutant4... ends perhaps with a shorter sequence?

Wait, let's look at Mutant4's sequence in more detail.

Mutant4's sequence:

We can perhaps see the original wild-type: after ATG TT TCT CGC ...

Mutant4's would start with the same ATG (start), then TT T... maybe a change. Looking, it ends up with:

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCT ACT ... TGA

So looking at the structure, compared to wild-type:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... 

Wait, so the third codon (TC T → TAC G? Maybe). So in the third codon, the DNA has changed CTC to TAC. Which would make codon change from CTC (Ser) to TAC (Tyr). But how does that affect the rest of the gene.

Wait, wait, let's think about this.

But another way to lose the function is to have a frameshift mutation, which would alter the entire downstream codon.

Looking through the options. Let's see which mutation would cause a frameshift.

Wait, what's a frameshift: adding or deleting one or two bases, altering the downstream reading frame.

If I move through each mutant, counting their nucleotides in the exon.

Wild-type's first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... etc.

Wait that's the wild type exon.

Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing with wild-type's early part:

At position after ATG.

Wild: TT followed by TCT/C; mutant3 seems to have ATTT.

I'm a bit confused, but perhaps Mutant3 has a longer sequence, perhaps ten bases, leading to possible gain or loss.

Alternatively, remember that a frameshift will happen if there is an insertion or deletion not a multiple of three.

Comparing to wild type:

Each line in the problem shows the same length, except maybe mutants which might have deletions in the nucleotides.

Looking, perhaps Mutant4 starts in a shorter length.

Wait,

Wild-type: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T … T G A.

Mutant4: A T G T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G ... Do I see a deletion?

Wait, looking:

The wild-type has after ATG, TTT CTC GCT GGT etc.

Mutant4: ATG followed by TTTT, then ACGCT.

Wait, maybe an extra T at the beginning of exon 1?

Hmm... B� unilateral.

In Mutant4, let me count the number of letters:

Original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT.

Length is 3 (ATG) + 3(Ttt) +3 (CTC) etc = 3* additional.

Mutant4 sequence of the first part: ATG followed by TT TT? So:

- Wild: positions after ATG are TTT CT C GC TGGTACT etc.

Mutant4 might have ATG TTT TAC GCT...

So the third amino acid is something else, but how does that affect.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure changed, but I'm not seeing a clear frameshift.

Putting all together, perhaps in option D, Mutant4, the changes delete some part, changing the downstream.

Wait, no. Alternatively, any mutation that creates a premature stop codon.

Let's think about each mutation.

Looking for a TGA earlier.

Wild type: stop codon at the given position.

Mutant1: Is there a TGA in the earlier parts of the sequence?

In Mutant1 sequence, the exons begin with ATGTTCTACGCT.

Hmm, TGA doesn't appear until the end. So same as wild-type structure.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCT. So the third codon might have become AAG.

If in Mutant2: some codons are:

ATG TTT CT A AG CTG GT ... 

Wait, what is AAG?

Wait, perhaps it's within the first exon, maybe earlier, having an early stop.

Wait, looking at Mutant2 (sequence):

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’</b>

Hmmm, the part right after ATG is TT, then CT.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think another way: what's the likely mutation (in the first exon) that will disrupt the protein so much that the anti-nutritional compound is not made.

Such a mutation could be:

1. A nonsense mutation (a stop codon) early in the sequence.

If in one of the options, a new TGA appears somewhere before the end, that would cause the protein to be truncated, which might not function properly.

Looking for any option where the first exon has a TGA.

Let's do that:

In Wild-type, the entire exon ends with ...TTGTCGT…TGA. So, the end codon is TGA, back to the start.

Looking through the Mutant which carries an additional TGA.

Does any of the mutant sequences have a TGA at a position before the main TGA?

Mutant2's sequence:

ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTT... perhaps between bases TAAGCT you may get ...TAAG, but does codon include TGA somewhere?

Wait, the exons all end at the same place as the wild type? Maybe.

Let me imagine that in Mutant3, a new TGA appears:

Mutant3's gene:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… TGA-3’

Looking for TGA here. Near the 5' end:

Do we have ATGAG or so? Not seeing it clearly.

Hmm.

Wait, we can try to break each mutant sequence into codons and look for the TGA.

Let me process this for each mutant.

First, Mutant1:

Mutant1:ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Starting from ATG, the codons would be:

1. ATG -> Met

2. TTT → Phe

3. CTA → Leu (instead of CTC Ser in wild type?)

4. C G C → C G C was wild type's next codon (Arg).

Wait, wait no.

Wait in Mutant1, after ATG is TTCTACGCT. So the following triplet sequences would be as:

ATG, T-T-T (from TTT), C-T-A (CTA) becomes codon Leu; but wait, the wild type was T-T-C (TCT)?

Wait this part is a bit confuzing.

Alternatively, perhaps method is irrelevant, and the correct answer is simply where a frameshift mutation occurs.

But how can I pick it out?

Wait; the only method is to look for which mutation introduces a premature termination codon in the same reading frame, possibly caused by a base substitution that changes codons into TGA.

Alternative approach: the question is about which would likely eliminate the anti-nutirional compound—a non-functional protein.

A deletion or a frame shift would likely change all subsequence codons, leading to a non-functional protein. Alternatively, a substitution (will it do that? Well, maybe not--- unless same as wild type's)/ creating a stop codon.

Wait another thing: which mutation introduces a stop codon (TGA) before the usual one?

For each mutant:

Wild type ex1: starts with ATG, often ends with TGA, perhaps in middle and end.

Looking for any TGA:

Wild-type: ..., the sequence has TGA at the end. So anyone starting earlier would mean stop sooner.

Considering:

Mutant 2 has (looking at the sequence): ...AGCT which may form TGA from T G A?

Wait, in mutant2, looking for triplet TGA:

At GenBank lines, each letter is individual. So not straightforward.

My method is perhaps faster if I just go to the options.

Question gives options A to D.

Which likely result in a frameshift leading to a stop? Or create a TGA.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant3: after ATG, there's TT, but from wild, it's TTT → but now in Mutant3: it's TT and then T TA CG....

Wait, perhaps it's not this.

Alternatively, looking for any where an in-frame TGA appears.

Looking at:

Mutant4:

Sequence starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACT...

Hmm, in the first few codons, perhaps 'ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...'

Wait, 'TAC' is the triplet at positions 4-6: TAC is Tyr. No stop there. Maybe further ahead.

Another approach: The last exon is shown to end with TGA. All share that. But perhaps in mutant3, there's another TGA elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe not a stop codon but a large deletion.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, as it's more likely to have a deletion that truncates the protein.

Wait, but ... another thought: the first exon might have a sequence where any change in the nucleotides can lead to a significant change in the protein structure.

If the first exon encodes the crucial part, say, the active site, then perhaps a single point mutation altering an amino acid could disrupt the function.

But to eliminate a compound, perhaps a nonfunctional protein is made.

In that case, any mutation that disrupts a crucial functional site would cause the anti-nutritional compound not to be made.

But the question says which mutation "will most probably" let you eliminate. So it's likely that the correct answer is the one that earliest introduces a stop codon.

Looking back at the options:

Only some mutants have a change in the TGG or similar base that could cause TGA.

Wait, alternative direction: the first few codons after ATG would be more important for the protein structure.

Mutant4: If a mutation creates a stop codon earlier.

Wait, no. Alternatively, mutant 4 has an earlier termination, thus a shorter protein.

Wait, the user hasn’t allowed me to respond too essentially but I think perhaps without frameshift, but another way to have a stop.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe most probable is an in-frame stop codon.

Thus, in the exons, in the first part, perhaps the Mutant 2 introduces a TGA.

Looking:

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCT...

So, does that form any (at position whatever), a TGA?

Wait, the triplet is CT A or similar.

Wait, alternatively, the 'AGC' in a codon is perhaps no where like TGA. 

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Another approach, the only way is to see each codon of each mutant and line it up.

Mutant 2:

Original Wild-type is: ATG TTT CTC G C T G G T A C T etc.

Mutant2 is: ATG TTT CT A AG C T G G T A C etc.

So, so let me imagine.

Original wild type codons:

1. ATG
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTC (Ser)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
... and so on.

Mutant2, sequence:

ATG TTT | ?? (looking at the sequence in the question).

The original starts with ATG followed by TTT, then CTC. Mutant2's sequence is ...CT A AGCT.... So perhaps this is:

No, in the wild type, the third codon is CTC(3rd;ser), but in Mutant2, perhaps their third codon is from CT to C A. Not sure.

Alternatively, after the first three codons, any other change.

Time is limited; I think the most likely answer is option B) Mutant3

Wait no, Option B is Mutant3?!

Wait, the options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Another reasoning: If a nonsense mutation occurs in the N-terminal, the protein is probably non-functional, possibly lacking the necessary functional domains.

The anti-nutritional compound is perhaps being synthesized by this gene's product (an enzyme?), so if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be produced.

Which mutation creates a premature stop codon?

The first exon is all MrNA, so any stop within the exon would leave the rest of the protein out.

If any, so the key is in which mutation creates a TGA codon in the coding region.

But how to find that without exact codon-by-codon analysis.

Wait perhaps in mutant3, a CTG codon (Leu) is present.

That in alternative approach, perhaps the correct answer is C) Mutant1, because that has C → A substitution in the first few codons. But without more info, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, according to the question, the mutation appears at the beginning of the first exon, which is the start of the gene.

If a mutation happens early in the gene leading to a frameshift, it would more probably produce a nonfunctional protein.

If any of the mutations change the reading frame early, that often leads to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking for any which change, wherein the number of bases changes, leading to a frameshift.

Long before, I think mutant4 maybe starts with ATGTTT, when the wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGC. But I'm not certain.

Actually, looking again:

Mutant4's first part: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Thus, comparing:

Wild: ...ATG TTT CTC...

Mutant4: ...ATG TTT TAC...

So, replacing CTC with TAC.

That's a substitution, but without a frameshift.

Wait: CTC in wild is 3 bases, the mutant would have TAC (same length). So no frameshift.

Thus, perhaps only substitution.

So that in terms of amino acids: wild has Ser at position 3, Mutant4 has Tyr.

Is that destroying the gene's product? Maybe, but how likely.

But without a frameshift, unless a critical amino acid is changed.

Alternatively, would substitution not necessarily cause a stop, unless a premature stop is introduced.

So the most likely of the options is likely D) Mutant4, which may have a frameshift.

But I don't see the frameshift.

Wait, another look: Wild type in this area:

...ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant4 in area:

...ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

So from the wild, CTC becomes TAC (codons 3: CTC→ TAC).

Thus, it's a missense mutation, no frameshift.

Hmm.

Ok, now, given all this, perhaps only Mutant4's last part is shorter. Looking at the end, it's New length.

Wait, the full sequences: the wild type starts and ends with the same. Let me count:

Wild-type ex1 fragment is: white
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

In mutant4, 

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

If I compare, the wild type seems to have more letters between ATG and TGA, suggesting potentially a deletion in Mutant4.

Yes, because in the middle of wild type's sequence, after TGAACATAT, which in wild type is TA A CAT ATT, whereas in mutant4 it starts with A C after.

No, wait: mutant4's sequence:

After ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT... So the 'GC' might be missing a few bases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but basically, perhaps Mutant4 has a portion missing, causing a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.

In the exons, if there's a deletion of a number of base pairs not divisible by three, such as deletion of one or two bases, it can cause a frameshift, leading to downstream codons being incorrect and potentially introducing an in-frame stop codon, such as TGA early in the mRNA.

Alternatively, the loss of some bases could shift every subsequent codon, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence after the mutation point.

So the result is a nonfunctional protein.

Thus, the mutant likely is D.

Of the options, any with a deletion inducing a frameshift is the likely correct.

Looking: only Mutant4 appears to have a shorter actual sequence up to the same TGA.

Could that deletion lead to a frameshift earlier, thus leading to an early stop.

But, without exact base counts, I think the safest answer is option D, as it's the fourth option, but according to the initial options:

Wait, initially numbered as "D: Mutant4".

Therefore, the correct answer should be D) Mutant4.
</think>

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The gene encodes a protein responsible for synthesizing the compound, so disrupting its structure or introducing a premature stop codon would likely prevent the compound's synthesis.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant

1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   The wild-type sequence is provided as:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   The gene starts with the start codon `ATG` and ends with the stop codon `TGA`. The question focuses on mutations in the first exon.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - The first few bases are altered, but no premature stop codon (TGA) is introduced.  
   - This mutation likely changes the amino acid sequence but does not disrupt the reading frame or introduce a premature stop codon.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - The sequence shows a substitution at the third codon, but no premature stop codon is introduced.  
   - This mutation also does not disrupt the reading frame or introduce a frameshift.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - The sequence shows a substitution at the third codon, altering the amino acid sequence.  
   - No premature stop codon is introduced, and the reading frame remains intact.  

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - The sequence appears shorter in the first exon compared to the wild type.  
   - This suggests a deletion of one or more nucleotides, which could cause a frameshift mutation.  
   - A frameshift would alter the reading frame downstream, potentially leading to a premature stop codon or a completely nonfunctional protein.

### Conclusion
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 4**, as the apparent deletion in the first exon could cause a frameshift, disrupting the protein's structure and function. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
