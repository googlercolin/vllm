Question: You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>
A) Mutant 2
B) Mutant 3
C) Mutant 1
D) Mutant 4

Assistant Response:
To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the reading frame or causes a premature stop codon, effectively disabling the gene's function. This can be achieved by altering the starting sequence in a way that introduces a premature stop codon (TAA, TGA, or TAG) or changes the reading frame.

Let's assess each mutant:

- **Mutant 1**: A single nucleotide change from C to A does not introduce a premature stop codon or change the reading frame significantly.
- **Mutant 2**: A single nucleotide change from C to G does not introduce a premature stop codon or change the reading frame significantly.
- **Mutant 3**: A single nucleotide change from C to A in the first three nucleotides of the sequence could potentially introduce a premature stop codon, but it does not clearly fit into one of the standard stop codons (TAA, TGA, TAG).
- **Mutant 4**: A single nucleotide change from T to A in the 19th position could introduce a premature stop codon (TGA), which would likely disable the gene's function.

Considering the introduced changes and their potential harmful effects, Mutant 4 is the most likely to result in a premature stop codon, effectively disabling the gene and potentially eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
